# ADR-014 Compliance: Repository Layer for CRUD Operations

This document tracks compliance with ADR-014, which mandates that all data access in service files must go through the repository layer. Services should not directly access the database or use SQLAlchemy queries but instead use repositories for all CRUD operations.

## Detailed Violation Analysis

### Additional Service Violations

#### Recurring Income Service Violations

The recurring_income service directly uses SQLAlchemy for all operations:

```python
# Direct database access with query building:
stmt = select(Account).where(Account.id == income_data.account_id)
result = await self.db.execute(stmt)
account = result.unique().scalar_one_or_none()
```

```python
# Direct session management:
self.db.add(recurring_income)
await self.db.commit()
await self.db.refresh(recurring_income)
```

Should be refactored to use repositories:

```python
# Using repositories:
account = await self.account_repository.get(income_data.account_id)
```

```python
# Using repository for creating:
return await self.recurring_income_repository.create(income_data.model_dump())
```

#### Statement History Service Violations

The statement_history service directly uses SQLAlchemy:

```python
# Direct database access:
result = await self.db.execute(select(Account).where(Account.id == account_id))
account = result.scalar_one_or_none()
```

```python
# Direct database manipulation:
self.db.add(statement)
return statement
```

Should be refactored to use repositories:

```python
# Using repositories:
account = await self.account_repository.get(account_id)
```

```python
# Using repository for creation:
return await self.statement_repository.create(statement_data)
```

#### Recurring Bills Service Violations

The recurring_bills service directly uses database operations:

```python
# Direct SQLAlchemy queries:
stmt = select(RecurringBill).options(
    joinedload(RecurringBill.account), joinedload(RecurringBill.liabilities)
)
```

```python
# Direct session management:
self.db.add(db_recurring_bill)
await self.db.commit()
await self.db.refresh(db_recurring_bill)
```

Should be refactored to use repositories:

```python
# Using repositories:
return await self.recurring_bill_repository.get_with_relationships(recurring_bill_id)
```

```python
# Using repository for creation:
return await self.recurring_bill_repository.create(recurring_bill_create.model_dump())
```

#### Balance Reconciliation Service Violations

The balance_reconciliation service directly uses session management:

```python
# Direct session access:
account = await self.session.get(Account, reconciliation_data.account_id)
```

```python
# Direct session manipulation:
self.session.add(reconciliation)
await self.session.commit()
await self.session.refresh(reconciliation)
```

Should be refactored to use repositories:

```python
# Using repositories:
account = await self.account_repository.get(reconciliation_data.account_id)
```

```python
# Using repository for creation:
reconciliation = await self.reconciliation_repository.create(reconciliation_data.model_dump())
```

### Deposit Schedules Service Violations

The deposit_schedules service directly uses SQLAlchemy for all operations:

```python
# Direct database access:
income = await self.session.get(Income, schedule.income_id)
if not income:
    return False, "Income not found", None

# Direct database session management:
self.session.add(db_schedule)
await self.session.commit()
await self.session.refresh(db_schedule)
```

Should be refactored to use repositories:

```python
# Using repositories:
income = await self.income_repository.get(schedule.income_id)

# Using repository for creating:
db_schedule = await self.deposit_schedule_repository.create(schedule.model_dump())
```

### Income Trends Service Violations

The income_trends service directly uses SQLAlchemy:

```python
# Direct database query building:
query = select(Income)
if request.start_date:
    query = query.where(Income.date >= request.start_date)

# Direct database execution:
result = await self.db.execute(query)
income_records = result.scalars().all()
```

Should be refactored to use repositories:

```python
# Using repositories:
income_records = await self.income_repository.get_with_filters(
    start_date=request.start_date,
    end_date=request.end_date,
    source=request.source
)
```

### Transactions Service Violations

The transactions service directly uses database operations:

```python
# Direct account access:
account = await self.session.get(Account, account_id)
if not account:
    raise ValueError(f"Account with id {account_id} not found")

# Direct session manipulation:
self.session.add(transaction)
await self.session.commit()
await self.session.refresh(transaction)
```

Should be refactored to use repositories:

```python
# Using repositories:
account = await self.account_repository.get(account_id)

# Repository creation:
transaction = await self.transaction_repository.create({
    "account_id": account_id,
    "amount": transaction_data.amount,
    "transaction_type": transaction_data.transaction_type,
    "description": transaction_data.description,
    "transaction_date": transaction_data.transaction_date,
})
```

### Realtime Cashflow Service Violations

The realtime_cashflow service extensively uses direct database access:

```python
# Direct query building:
query = select(Account)
result = await self.db.execute(query)
accounts = result.scalars().all()

# Complex direct query operations:
transfers_query = (
    select(PaymentSource)
    .join(Payment, PaymentSource.payment_id == Payment.id)
    .where(
        and_(
            PaymentSource.account_id.in_([acc1.id, acc2.id]),
            Payment.category == "Transfer",
        )
    )
)
```

Should be refactored to use repositories:

```python
# Using repositories:
accounts = await self.account_repository.get_all()

# Using specialized repository methods:
transfers = await self.payment_source_repository.get_transfers_between_accounts(
    account_ids=[acc1.id, acc2.id]
)
```

### Cashflow Metrics Service Violations

The cashflow/metrics_service directly uses SQLAlchemy:

```python
# Direct query building:
accounts_query = select(Account)
accounts = (await self.db.execute(accounts_query)).scalars().all()

# Complex direct database access:
result = await self.db.execute(
    select(Liability)
    .outerjoin(Payment)
    .where(
        Liability.primary_account_id == account_id,
        Liability.due_date >= start_date,
        Liability.due_date <= end_date,
        Payment.id == None,  # No associated payments
    )
)
```

Should be refactored to use repositories:

```python
# Using repositories:
accounts = await self.account_repository.get_all()

# Using specialized repository methods:
liabilities = await self.liability_repository.get_unpaid_in_date_range(
    account_id=account_id,
    start_date=start_date,
    end_date=end_date
)
```

2. **Dependency Injection**: Update the factory.py file to include all new repositories
3. **Repository Method Design**:
   - Design repository methods to support all service use cases
   - Consider specialized methods for complex queries
   - Ensure repositories follow the polymorphic pattern where appropriate
4. **Testing**:
   - Implement integration tests for each repository
   - Ensure service functionality remains identical after refactoring
5. **Documentation**:
   - Update service documentation to reflect repository dependencies
   - Create comprehensive repository method documentation
6. **Factory Updates**:
   - Update or create factory methods for all repositories
   - Update service factories to inject repositories
