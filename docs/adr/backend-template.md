# ADR-{NUMBER}: {TITLE}

## Status

[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded by ADR-XXX]

## Executive Summary

A concise (3-5 sentences) summary of the ADR suitable for inclusion in the master ADR catalog at `/code/debtonator/docs/adr/README.md`. This should clearly explain the decision and its main purpose without technical details except for the specifc layers of the application that this ADR affects. Esnure to date the entry in the master catalog so we know the last time each ADR was reviewed.

## Context

- What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision or change?
- What is the business problem we are trying to solve?
- What are the key forces and constraints we're working with?
- Include numbers, metrics and SLAs where relevant
- Reference related decisions and known constraints

## Decision

- What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing?
- The "what" rather than the "how"
- Include high-level technical architecture diagrams where helpful
- List considered alternatives and why they were not chosen
- Reference any proof-of-concepts or prototypes that influenced the decision

### Dependencies and External Systems

- New dependencies being introduced
- Required changes to existing systems
- Integration with external services
- Version requirements and compatibility

### Implementation Impact

- How the change will be fully implemented across the codebase
- Required changes to existing features to maintain architectural integrity
- Expected database reset requirements, if any
- Coordination with related ADRs and features
- Complete adoption strategy across all system components
- Total scope of changes required for full implementation

## Consequences

### Positive

- List the expected benefits
- Include both technical and business benefits
- Quantify improvements where possible

### Negative

- What are the drawbacks?
- What technical debt might we be taking on?
- What are the risks and how will we mitigate them?
- What are the security implications?

### Neutral

- What are the neutral trade-offs?
- What capabilities will we gain or lose?
- What new requirements does this create?

## Quality Considerations

- How does this change maintain or improve code quality?
- What potential tech debt is being prevented by this approach?
- How does this solution address the root cause rather than symptoms?
- What existing patterns are being enforced or improved?
- What testing improvements will be implemented?
- How will documentation be enhanced to support this change?

## Performance and Resource Considerations

- What is the expected impact on system performance?
- Include baseline metrics where available
