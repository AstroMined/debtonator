# ADR-006: Redux Toolkit State Management Implementation

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The application needed a robust state management solution to handle:
- Complex state interactions between components
- Real-time data synchronization
- Efficient re-renders
- Type-safe state management
- Consistent data access patterns

Previously, state was managed through a combination of local component state and prop drilling, which became increasingly difficult to maintain as the application grew.

## Decision
Implement Redux Toolkit as the global state management solution with the following structure:

1. Domain-specific slices:
   - Accounts: Managing account balances, limits, and status
   - Bills: Handling bill payments, splits, and status
   - Income: Tracking deposits and undeposited amounts
   - Cashflow: Managing forecasts and minimum requirements

2. Type-safe implementation:
   - TypeScript integration
   - Strongly typed actions and state
   - Type-safe selectors

3. Performance optimizations:
   - Memoized selectors
   - Efficient state updates
   - Optimized re-renders

## Consequences

### Positive
1. Centralized State Management
   - Single source of truth for application state
   - Consistent data access patterns
   - Improved state predictability

2. Type Safety
   - Compile-time error catching
   - Better developer experience
   - Reduced runtime errors

3. Performance
   - Optimized re-renders through memoization
   - Efficient state updates
   - Better handling of real-time updates

4. Developer Experience
   - Clear data flow patterns
   - Redux DevTools integration
   - Easier debugging

### Negative
1. Additional Boilerplate
   - More initial setup required
   - More files to maintain
   - Learning curve for new developers

2. Complexity
   - Additional abstraction layer
   - More concepts to understand
   - Potential over-engineering for simple state

## Implementation Details

### State Structure
```typescript
interface RootState {
  accounts: AccountsState;
  bills: BillsState;
  income: IncomeState;
  cashflow: CashflowState;
}
```

### Key Features
1. Type-safe actions and reducers
2. Efficient selectors with memoization
3. Real-time state synchronization
4. Comprehensive error handling
5. Loading state management

### Usage Patterns
```typescript
// Selecting state
const accounts = useAppSelector(selectAccounts);
const filteredBills = useAppSelector(selectFilteredBills);

// Dispatching actions
const dispatch = useAppDispatch();
dispatch(updateBalance({ id, amount }));
```

## Alternatives Considered

### React Context
- Pros: Built into React, simpler setup
- Cons: Less performant, no dev tools, harder to test

### MobX
- Pros: Less boilerplate, reactive by default
- Cons: Less predictable, harder to debug, smaller community

### Zustand
- Pros: Simpler API, less boilerplate
- Cons: Less mature, smaller ecosystem, fewer tools

## Future Considerations
1. Potential integration with React Query for server state
2. Implementation of middleware for side effects
3. Enhanced performance optimizations
4. Improved testing patterns
