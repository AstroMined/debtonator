## Status

[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded by ADR-XXX]

## Executive Summary

A concise (3-5 sentences) summary of the ADR suitable for inclusion in the master ADR catalog at `/code/debtonator/docs/adr/README.md`. This should clearly explain the decision and its main purpose without technical details except for the specific components that this ADR affects. Ensure to date the entry in the master catalog so we know the last time each ADR was reviewed.

## Context

- What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision or change?
- What user experience problem are we trying to solve?
- What are the key forces and constraints we're working with?
- Include user research data, metrics, and usability findings where relevant
- Reference related backend decisions and UI/UX constraints

## Decision

- What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing?
- The "what" rather than the "how"
- Include wireframes or mockups where helpful
- List considered alternatives and why they were not chosen
- Reference any design prototypes or user testing that influenced the decision

### User Stories

#### Category 1: Primary User Flow

##### **US-1.1: Key User Story**

- As a [role], I want to [action]
- So that [benefit/outcome]

##### **US-1.2: Secondary User Story**

- As a [role], I want to [action]
- So that [benefit/outcome]

#### Category 2: Secondary User Flow

##### **US-2.1: Supporting User Story**

- As a [role], I want to [action]
- So that [benefit/outcome]

### User Interface and Click Paths

#### Primary View

**Elements:**

- List of key UI components on the screen
- Their visual hierarchy and relationships
- Interactive elements and their states

##### **Click Path:** Main User Flow

1. Step-by-step user interaction
2. Expected system response
3. Visual feedback and transitions
4. Final state and outcome

### Wireframes

Include ASCII diagrams or embedded images of key UI screens. For ASCII wireframes:

```wireframe
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| Header                                                      |
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| Sidebar            |  Main Content Area                     |
|                    |                                        |
| Navigation         |  Key interaction elements              |
| Elements           |  Data visualization                   |
|                    |  User input forms                      |
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| Footer                                                      |
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
```

- Provide clear annotations for each section
- Indicate interactive elements
- Show visual hierarchy through layout
