# ADR-028: Feature Flag Management Frontend

## Status

Proposed

## Executive Summary

This ADR defines the frontend implementation for the feature flag management system established in ADR-024. We will create a React-based admin interface that enables non-technical administrators to manage feature flags through an intuitive dashboard with toggle controls, configuration options, and requirement management. The frontend will provide visibility into feature rollouts, usage metrics, and change history while maintaining proper separation from the backend implementation.

## Context

As detailed in ADR-024, we are implementing a comprehensive feature flag system with a database-driven approach for both flag values and requirements mapping. While ADR-024 focuses on the backend implementation, an intuitive and powerful frontend interface is needed to enable non-technical administrators to manage feature flags effectively without direct database access.

The feature flag management frontend will provide a user-friendly interface for controlling the rollout of new features like banking account types, multi-currency support, and international account support. It needs to be powerful enough for technical users while remaining accessible for product managers and operations staff.

## Decision

We will implement a dedicated frontend for feature flag management as part of the Debtonator admin console with the following capabilities:

1. A dashboard-style view of all feature flags with their status
2. Toggle controls for enabling/disabling features
3. Interface for configuring percentage rollouts and user segmentation
4. Management of feature requirements across repository, service, and API layers
5. Visibility into flag usage and history
6. Role-based access control for different admin user types

## Technical Details

### Architecture Overview

The feature flag management frontend follows a component-based architecture using React with TypeScript, leveraging Material-UI for consistent design and Redux Toolkit for state management. The interface is designed with performance and accessibility in mind, featuring optimistic updates for responsive user experience and proper ARIA attributes for screen readers.

### Technology Stack

The feature flag management frontend will be implemented using our existing React-based frontend stack:

- **React with TypeScript**: Component-based UI with type safety
- **Redux Toolkit**: State management with normalized data structures
- **Material-UI**: Comprehensive component library with responsive design
- **React Router v6**: Client-side routing with nested layouts
- **Formik**: Form state management with complex validation
- **Yup**: Schema validation for form data
- **Recharts**: Interactive data visualization for metrics
- **React Query**: API data fetching with caching and synchronization

### Component Structure

#### Core Components

```typescript
interface FeatureFlagDashboardProps {
  isLoading: boolean;
  flags: FeatureFlag[];
  onToggle: (flagName: string, newValue: boolean) => void;
  onFilterChange: (filters: FilterState) => void;
}

const FeatureFlagDashboard: React.FC<FeatureFlagDashboardProps> = ({
  // Implementation
});
```

1. **FeatureFlagDashboard**
   - FeatureFlagList: Virtualized list for performance with large datasets
   - FeatureFlagFilters: Multi-select dropdowns for status/type filtering
   - FeatureFlagSearchBar: Real-time search with debouncing

2. **FeatureFlagDetail**
   - FeatureFlagHeader: Flag name and quick actions
   - FeatureFlagTabs: Tab navigation with React Router
     - GeneralTab: Basic information and metadata
     - ConfigurationTab: Type-specific configuration controls
     - RequirementsTab: Layer-based requirements management
     - HistoryTab: Audit log with diff visualization

3. **RequirementsManager**
   - RequirementsList: Grouped by layer with sorting
   - RequirementEditor: Form-based editor with validation
   - RequirementAddModal: Step-by-step creation flow

4. **FeatureFlagHistory**
   - HistoryTimeline: Chronological display with filtering
   - ChangeDetailView: Before/after comparison with highlighting

#### Configuration Components

```typescript
interface PercentageRolloutProps {
  value: number;
  onChange: (value: number) => void;
  disabled?: boolean;
}

const PercentageRollout: React.FC<PercentageRolloutProps> = ({
  // Implementation including slider and increment buttons
});
```

### API Integration

The frontend will use React Query for API communication with proper error handling and caching:

```typescript
// API Client Setup
const apiClient = axios.create({
  baseURL: '/api/admin',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
});

// React Query Hooks
const useFeatureFlags = () =>
  useQuery(['featureFlags'], () => apiClient.get('/feature-flags').then(res => res.data));

const useFeatureFlag = (flagName: string) =>
  useQuery(['featureFlag', flagName], () => 
    apiClient.get(`/feature-flags/${flagName}`).then(res => res.data),
    { enabled: !!flagName }
  );

const useUpdateFeatureFlag = () =>
  useMutation(
    (data: { flagName: string; value: any }) =>
      apiClient.put(`/feature-flags/${data.flagName}`, { value: data.value }),
    {
      onSuccess: () => {
        queryClient.invalidateQueries(['featureFlags']);
      },
    }
  );
```

#### API Endpoints

- GET `/api/admin/feature-flags` - List all feature flags
- GET `/api/admin/feature-flags/{flag_name}` - Get flag details
- PUT `/api/admin/feature-flags/{flag_name}` - Update flag value
- GET `/api/admin/feature-flags/{flag_name}/requirements` - Get requirements
- PUT `/api/admin/feature-flags/{flag_name}/requirements` - Update requirements
- GET `/api/admin/feature-flags/{flag_name}/history` - Get change history
- GET `/api/admin/feature-flags/{flag_name}/metrics` - Get usage metrics

### State Management

Redux Toolkit will manage the application state with normalized data structures:

```typescript
interface FeatureFlagsState {
  entities: Record<string, FeatureFlag>;
  ids: string[];
  loading: boolean;
  error: string | null;
  filters: FilterState;
}

const featureFlagsSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'featureFlags',
  initialState,
  reducers: {
    setFilter: (state, action: PayloadAction<FilterState>) => {
      state.filters = action.payload;
    },
    // Other reducers...
  },
  extraReducers: (builder) => {
    builder
      .addCase(fetchFeatureFlags.pending, (state) => {
        state.loading = true;
      })
      .addCase(fetchFeatureFlags.fulfilled, (state, action) => {
        const normalized = normalize(action.payload);
        state.entities = normalized.entities;
        state.ids = normalized.ids;
        state.loading = false;
      });
  },
});
```

### Form Validation Schema

Complex form validation using Formik and Yup:

```typescript
const requirementSchema = Yup.object().shape({
  layer: Yup.string()
    .oneOf(['repository', 'service', 'api'])
    .required('Layer is required'),
  operationType: Yup.string()
    .oneOf(['method', 'endpoint'])
    .required('Operation type is required'),
  namePattern: Yup.string()
    .when('operationType', {
      is: 'endpoint',
      then: Yup.string().matches(/^\//, 'Endpoint must start with /'),
      otherwise: Yup.string().required('Name is required'),
    }),
  accountTypes: Yup.array()
    .of(Yup.string())
    .when('layer', {
      is: 'repository',
      then: Yup.array().min(1, 'Select at least one account type'),
    }),
});
```

## Notes

1. **Decision Points**:
   - Chose React Query over Redux Thunks for API integration for better caching
   - Selected Material-UI over custom components for faster development
   - Decided on client-side validation first approach for better UX

2. **Assumptions**:
   - Existing admin authentication system can be reused
   - Backend API will be available before frontend development begins
   - Material-UI components sufficient for all UI needs

3. **Risks and Mitigations**:
   - Complex UI may be overwhelming → Phased rollout with user feedback
   - Performance with large datasets → Virtualization and pagination
   - Technical requirements intuitive for non-tech users → User testing and iteration
