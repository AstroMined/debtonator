# ADR-028: Feature Flag Management Frontend

## Status

Proposed

## Context

As detailed in ADR-024, we are implementing a comprehensive feature flag system with a database-driven approach for both flag values and requirements mapping. While ADR-024 focuses on the backend implementation, an intuitive and powerful frontend interface is needed to enable non-technical administrators to manage feature flags effectively without direct database access.

The feature flag management frontend will provide a user-friendly interface for controlling the rollout of new features like banking account types, multi-currency support, and international account support. It needs to be powerful enough for technical users while remaining accessible for product managers and operations staff.

## Decision

We will implement a dedicated frontend for feature flag management as part of the Debtonator admin console with the following capabilities:

1. A dashboard-style view of all feature flags with their status
2. Toggle controls for enabling/disabling features
3. Interface for configuring percentage rollouts and user segmentation
4. Management of feature requirements across repository, service, and API layers
5. Visibility into flag usage and history
6. Role-based access control for different admin user types

### User Stories

#### 1. Flag Overview and Management

**US-1.1: View Feature Flags Dashboard**
- As an administrator, I want to see a dashboard of all feature flags with their current status
- So that I can quickly understand the state of all features in the system

**US-1.2: Filter and Search Flags**
- As an administrator, I want to filter feature flags by status, type, or layer
- So that I can focus on specific subsets of flags that need attention

**US-1.3: Toggle Feature Flags**
- As an administrator, I want to toggle feature flags on/off with a simple switch
- So that I can quickly enable or disable features without technical knowledge

**US-1.4: View Flag Details**
- As an administrator, I want to view detailed information about a specific flag
- So that I can understand its purpose, configuration, and impact

#### 2. Feature Configuration

**US-2.1: Configure Percentage Rollouts**
- As an administrator, I want to configure percentage-based rollouts for features
- So that I can gradually release features to increasing portions of users

**US-2.2: Configure User Segments**
- As an administrator, I want to enable features for specific user segments
- So that I can target features to appropriate user groups (e.g., beta testers)

**US-2.3: Schedule Feature Activation**
- As an administrator, I want to schedule when features should automatically activate or deactivate
- So that I can plan feature releases outside of business hours

#### 3. Requirements Management

**US-3.1: View Requirements**
- As an administrator, I want to see which methods/endpoints require a specific feature flag
- So that I understand the technical impact of enabling/disabling a flag

**US-3.2: Add Requirements**
- As a technical administrator, I want to add new requirements to a feature flag
- So that I can control which parts of the system are affected by the flag

**US-3.3: Edit Requirements**
- As a technical administrator, I want to modify existing requirements
- So that I can adjust the scope of a feature flag as the system evolves

**US-3.4: Remove Requirements**
- As a technical administrator, I want to remove requirements from a feature flag
- So that I can narrow the scope of a feature flag when needed

#### 4. Monitoring and History

**US-4.1: View Usage Metrics**
- As an administrator, I want to see how often each feature flag is checked
- So that I can understand which flags are most active in the system

**US-4.2: View Change History**
- As an administrator, I want to see a history of changes to feature flags
- So that I can track when and by whom flags were modified

**US-4.3: View Blocked Features**
- As an administrator, I want to see which features are currently blocked by disabled flags
- So that I can understand the impact of current flag configurations

## Technical Implementation

### Technology Stack

The feature flag management frontend will be implemented using our existing React-based frontend stack:

- React with TypeScript
- Redux Toolkit for state management
- Material-UI for UI components
- React Router for navigation
- Formik and Yup for form handling and validation
- Recharts for usage metrics visualization

### Component Structure

1. **FeatureFlagDashboard**
   - FeatureFlagList
   - FeatureFlagFilters
   - FeatureFlagSearchBar

2. **FeatureFlagDetail**
   - FeatureFlagHeader
   - FeatureFlagTabs
     - GeneralTab
     - ConfigurationTab
     - RequirementsTab
     - HistoryTab

3. **RequirementsManager**
   - RequirementsList
   - RequirementEditor
   - RequirementAddModal

4. **FeatureFlagHistory**
   - HistoryTimeline
   - ChangeDetailView

### API Integration

The frontend will integrate with the backend API endpoints defined in ADR-024:

- GET `/api/admin/feature-flags` - List all feature flags
- GET `/api/admin/feature-flags/{flag_name}` - Get flag details
- PUT `/api/admin/feature-flags/{flag_name}` - Update flag value
- GET `/api/admin/feature-flags/{flag_name}/requirements` - Get requirements
- PUT `/api/admin/feature-flags/{flag_name}/requirements` - Update requirements
- GET `/api/admin/feature-flags/{flag_name}/history` - Get change history
- GET `/api/admin/feature-flags/{flag_name}/metrics` - Get usage metrics

### State Management

The Redux store will include slices for:

- **featureFlags**: List of all flags with basic info
- **selectedFlag**: Detailed data for the currently selected flag
- **flagHistory**: Change history for the current flag
- **flagMetrics**: Usage data for the current flag
- **ui**: UI state (loading states, error messages, etc.)

### Security Considerations

- Role-based access control will restrict access to the feature flag management interface
- Different permission levels will control who can view vs. modify flags
- Technical administrators will have additional permissions for requirements management
- All changes will be logged with the user who made them

## Consequences

### Positive

1. **User Empowerment**: Non-technical users can manage feature flags without developer intervention
2. **Operational Efficiency**: Features can be quickly enabled/disabled from a user-friendly interface
3. **Visibility**: Clear visualization of feature flag state across the system
4. **Safety**: Confirmation dialogs and impact summaries prevent accidental changes
5. **Auditability**: Complete history of changes for compliance and troubleshooting

### Negative

1. **Additional Maintenance**: New frontend to maintain and test
2. **Technical Requirements UX Challenge**: Making technical requirements management intuitive for all users
3. **Training Need**: Administrators need training on impact of feature flag changes

### Neutral

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Clearer separation between backend logic and admin interface
2. **API Dependence**: Frontend relies on well-defined API from ADR-024
3. **Role Definition**: Need to define appropriate admin roles and permissions
