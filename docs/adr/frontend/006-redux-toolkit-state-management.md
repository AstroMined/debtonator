# ADR-006: Redux Toolkit State Management Implementation

## Status

Accepted

## Executive Summary

This ADR adopts Redux Toolkit as the global state management solution for the Debtonator application. It implements a domain-driven slice architecture (accounts, bills, income, cashflow) with type-safe actions and selectors, memoization for performance optimization, and consistent data access patterns. The implementation provides a centralized source of truth for application state, enables efficient re-renders, and creates a scalable architecture capable of handling the complex state interactions required by Debtonator's financial management features.

## Context

As the Debtonator application continues to evolve, we face growing challenges in managing increasingly complex state across numerous components. Financial management applications have unique requirements for state management, including:

- Complex data relationships between accounts, bills, payments, and income
- Real-time calculations for cashflow projections and minimum balances
- Cross-component visibility of critical financial data
- Efficient re-rendering with complex nested data structures
- Type-safe state management to prevent financial calculation errors

Previously, state was managed through a combination of local component state and prop drilling, which became increasingly difficult to maintain as the application grew. This approach led to several challenges:

- Inconsistent data access patterns across components
- Difficulty tracking state changes and debugging issues
- Redundant data fetching and unnecessary re-renders
- Complex prop chains making component refactoring difficult
- Lack of centralized error handling for state updates

## Decision

We will implement Redux Toolkit as the global state management solution for the Debtonator application with the following architecture:

### Domain-Driven Slice Architecture

1. **Accounts Slice**:
   - Account entities, balances, limits, and status information
   - Account type-specific attributes and behaviors
   - Account filtering and search functionality

2. **Bills Slice**:
   - Bill entities with payment due dates and statuses
   - Primary account assignments and bill splits
   - Payment status tracking and history
   - Auto-pay status management

3. **Income Slice**:
   - Income sources and scheduled deposits
   - Undeposited income tracking
   - Income allocation to specific accounts
   - Recurring income patterns

4. **Cashflow Slice**:
   - Forecasting calculations for different time periods
   - Minimum required funds for different outlooks
   - Deficit tracking across time periods
   - Cross-account aggregated balance tracking

### Type-Safe Implementation

- Strongly typed state structure with TypeScript
- Type-safe action creators and reducers
- Properly typed selector functions
- Integration with RootState for better IDE support

### Performance Optimizations

- Memoized selectors with `createSelector` for derived data
- Entity adapter pattern for normalized state
- Efficient updates with `createSlice` immer integration
- Optimized re-renders through careful state structure design

### User Stories

#### User Story 1: Efficient State Access

- As a developer, I want to access application state consistently across components
- So that I can build features that work with financial data without prop drilling

#### User Story 2: Type-Safe State Updates

- As a developer, I want type-safe state updates with predictable patterns
- So that I can prevent errors in financial calculations and data management

#### User Story 3: Performance with Complex Data

- As a developer, I want optimized rendering with complex financial data
- So that the application remains responsive even with large datasets

### User Interface and Click Paths

While Redux Toolkit primarily affects the application architecture rather than direct UI elements, it enables consistent data flow for key user interactions:

#### Account Management Flow

**Elements:**

- Account list components
- Account detail forms
- Balance display elements
- Transaction history view

**Click Path:** Updating Account Balance

1. User navigates to Accounts view
2. Selects specific account to edit
3. Updates balance information
4. Submits changes
5. Redux handles state update and persistence
6. UI reflects new balance across all components
7. Cashflow projections automatically update based on new balance

#### Bill Management Flow

**Elements:**

- Bills table with sortable columns
- Bill detail panels
- Payment status indicators
- Account selection dropdowns

**Click Path:** Marking Bill as Paid

1. User navigates to Bills view
2. Locates specific bill in table
3. Toggles payment status
4. Redux updates bill state and affected account balances
5. UI reflects new payment status
6. Cashflow projections update to reflect payment
7. Account balances update across all components

### Wireframes

This architectural decision primarily affects application state management rather than visual elements. Therefore, detailed wireframes are not applicable. The focus is on data flow architecture and component interactions.

## Technical Details

### Architecture Overview

Redux Toolkit provides a centralized state management solution with the following key components:

```tree
Frontend Application
├── Redux Store
│   ├── Accounts Slice
│   ├── Bills Slice  
│   ├── Income Slice
│   └── Cashflow Slice
├── UI Components
│   ├── React Hooks for Redux Integration
│   └── Memoized Selectors
├── API Integration
│   └── Thunks for Async Operations
└── Type Definitions
    └── TypeScript Interfaces
```

Each slice manages its own section of the state tree, with clear boundaries between domains. Cross-slice interactions happen through selectors and middleware, ensuring clean separation of concerns.

### Technology Stack

- **Redux Toolkit**: Core state management library with optimized Redux patterns
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe implementation of actions, reducers, and state
- **React-Redux**: React bindings for Redux with hooks API
- **Immer**: Immutable state updates with mutable-style code
- **Reselect**: Memoized selectors for efficient derived data

### Component Structure

```typescript
// Example of typed state interface
interface AccountsState {
  entities: Record<string, Account>;
  ids: string[];
  status: 'idle' | 'loading' | 'succeeded' | 'failed';
  error: string | null;
  filters: {
    showHidden: boolean;
    searchTerm: string;
    accountTypes: string[];
  };
}

// Example of a slice definition
const accountsSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'accounts',
  initialState: {
    entities: {},
    ids: [],
    status: 'idle',
    error: null,
    filters: {
      showHidden: false,
      searchTerm: '',
      accountTypes: [],
    }
  } as AccountsState,
  reducers: {
    // Reducers implementation
    setFilter: (state, action: PayloadAction<Partial<AccountsState['filters']>>) => {
      state.filters = { ...state.filters, ...action.payload };
    },
    // Additional reducers...
  },
  extraReducers: (builder) => {
    // Handle async thunks
    builder
      .addCase(fetchAccounts.pending, (state) => {
        state.status = 'loading';
      })
      .addCase(fetchAccounts.fulfilled, (state, action) => {
        state.status = 'succeeded';
        accountsAdapter.setAll(state, action.payload);
      })
      .addCase(fetchAccounts.rejected, (state, action) => {
        state.status = 'failed';
        state.error = action.error.message || 'Failed to fetch accounts';
      });
  }
});
```

### State Management

#### Entity Adapters

For collections of entities (accounts, bills, etc.), we use the entity adapter pattern:

```typescript
// Entity adapter for normalized state
const accountsAdapter = createEntityAdapter<Account>({
  // Sort accounts by name
  sortComparer: (a, b) => a.name.localeCompare(b.name),
});

// Initial state includes adapter state
const initialState = accountsAdapter.getInitialState({
  status: 'idle',
  error: null,
  filters: {
    // Filter state
  }
});

// Adapter provides CRUD operations
const accountsSlice = createSlice({
  // ...
  reducers: {
    addAccount: accountsAdapter.addOne,
    updateAccount: accountsAdapter.updateOne,
    removeAccount: accountsAdapter.removeOne,
    // ...custom reducers
  }
});
```

#### Memoized Selectors

Performance optimization is crucial for financial calculations. We use memoized selectors:

```typescript
// Base selectors
export const selectAccountsState = (state: RootState) => state.accounts;
export const { selectAll: selectAllAccounts, selectById: selectAccountById } = 
  accountsAdapter.getSelectors(selectAccountsState);

// Memoized derived selectors for expensive calculations
export const selectFilteredAccounts = createSelector(
  [selectAllAccounts, (state: RootState) => state.accounts.filters],
  (accounts, filters) => {
    return accounts.filter(account => {
      // Apply filters
      if (filters.showHidden === false && account.isHidden) {
        return false;
      }
      
      if (filters.searchTerm && !account.name.toLowerCase().includes(filters.searchTerm.toLowerCase())) {
        return false;
      }
      
      if (filters.accountTypes.length > 0 && !filters.accountTypes.includes(account.accountType)) {
        return false;
      }
      
      return true;
    });
  }
);

// Complex financial calculations using memoization
export const selectAvailableFunds = createSelector(
  [selectAllAccounts],
  (accounts) => {
    return accounts.reduce((total, account) => {
      if (account.accountType === 'checking' || account.accountType === 'savings') {
        return total + account.availableBalance;
      }
      return total;
    }, 0);
  }
);
```

### API Integration

Redux Toolkit's createAsyncThunk provides a consistent pattern for API integration:

```typescript
// Async thunk for API calls
export const fetchAccounts = createAsyncThunk(
  'accounts/fetchAccounts',
  async (_, { rejectWithValue }) => {
    try {
      const response = await api.get('/accounts');
      return response.data;
    } catch (err) {
      return rejectWithValue(err.response.data);
    }
  }
);

// Creating or updating accounts
export const saveAccount = createAsyncThunk(
  'accounts/saveAccount',
  async (account: Partial<Account>, { rejectWithValue }) => {
    try {
      if (account.id) {
        // Update existing account
        const response = await api.put(`/accounts/${account.id}`, account);
        return response.data;
      } else {
        // Create new account
        const response = await api.post('/accounts', account);
        return response.data;
      }
    } catch (err) {
      return rejectWithValue(err.response.data);
    }
  }
);
```

### Form Validation

Form validation is implemented with a combination of Redux form state and Yup schemas:

```typescript
// Account form validation schema
const accountSchema = Yup.object().shape({
  name: Yup.string().required('Account name is required'),
  accountType: Yup.string().required('Account type is required'),
  currentBalance: Yup.number()
    .required('Current balance is required')
    .test('is-decimal', 'Amount must have 2 decimal places max', 
      value => /^\d+(\.\d{1,2})?$/.test(String(value))),
  // Additional validation rules...
});

// Integration with Formik and Redux
const AccountForm = ({ initialValues, onSubmit }) => {
  const dispatch = useAppDispatch();
  
  return (
    <Formik
      initialValues={initialValues}
      validationSchema={accountSchema}
      onSubmit={(values) => {
        dispatch(saveAccount(values))
          .unwrap()
          .then(() => {
            // Success handling
            onSubmit();
          })
          .catch((err) => {
            // Error handling
          });
      }}
    >
      {/* Form components */}
    </Formik>
  );
};
```

### Performance Optimizations from this ADR

Several performance optimizations are implemented:

1. **Normalized State Structure**:
   - Flat entity storage with references instead of nesting
   - Prevents deep object comparison issues
   - Enables efficient updates of individual entities

2. **Memoized Selectors**:
   - Prevents recalculation of derived data unless dependencies change
   - Particularly important for complex financial calculations
   - Reduces unnecessary re-renders

3. **Middleware Configuration**:
   - Customized middleware chain for development vs. production
   - Selective Redux DevTools usage based on environment
   - Serializable state check turned off only where necessary

4. **Component-Level Optimizations**:
   - React.memo for complex list items
   - Careful selector usage to prevent over-rendering
   - Throttling for rapidly changing values

### Accessibility Features

While Redux is primarily an architectural pattern rather than a UI component, the state management approach supports accessibility by:

1. **Consistent Loading States**:
   - Centralized loading state for proper screen reader announcements
   - Predictable focus management during state transitions

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Centralized error state for consistent error messaging
   - Accessibility-friendly error presentation

3. **State Persistence**:
   - Maintains form state during navigation, helpful for users with cognitive disabilities
   - Preserves user preferences and settings

### Security Considerations

The Redux implementation includes several security considerations:

1. **Input Sanitization**:
   - All user input is validated before entering the Redux store
   - Prevents XSS and injection attacks

2. **Sensitive Data Handling**:
   - Financial data is never stored in localStorage
   - Session-based authentication state management
   - Options for secure state persistence

3. **Redux Middleware Security**:
   - Custom middleware for validating actions
   - Prevents unauthorized state mutations
