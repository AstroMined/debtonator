# ADR 010: API Enhancement Strategy

## Status
Accepted

## Context
After a comprehensive review of our API endpoints and service layer functionality, we identified several gaps between our service capabilities and their API exposure. We need to enhance our API to ensure all core functionality is properly exposed and follows consistent patterns.

## Decision
We will implement API enhancements through a phased approach, focusing on one domain at a time:

1. Phase 1: Account Management Enhancement
   - Statement balance history
   - Credit limit tracking
   - Transaction history
   - Balance reconciliation
   - Available credit calculation

2. Phase 2: Bill Management Expansion
   - Recurring bills endpoints
   - Auto-pay functionality
   - Bill categorization
   - Payment scheduling
   - Bulk operations

3. Phase 3: Bill Splits Optimization
   - Split validation endpoints
   - Split suggestions
   - Historical analysis
   - Bulk operations
   - Impact analysis

4. Phase 4: Income System Enhancement
   - Income categorization
   - Trends analysis
   - Deposit scheduling
   - Recurring income
   - Analysis endpoints

5. Phase 5: Cashflow Analysis Extension
   - Real-time tracking
   - Cross-account analysis
   - Custom forecasts
   - Historical trends
   - Account-specific forecasts

6. Phase 6: Reporting & Analysis
   - Balance history endpoints
   - Payment patterns
   - Split analysis
   - Recommendations
   - Trend reporting

Each phase will include:
- Schema updates if needed
- Service layer enhancements
- API endpoint implementation
- Comprehensive testing
- Documentation updates

## Consequences

### Positive
- Organized, manageable enhancement process
- Focus on one domain at a time reduces complexity
- Clear progress tracking
- Easier testing and validation
- Maintains system stability
- Better documentation coverage

### Negative
- Longer timeline to complete all enhancements
- Need to maintain backward compatibility during updates
- Some cross-domain features may need to wait
- Temporary inconsistencies between enhanced and non-enhanced areas

### Mitigations
1. Careful planning of phase order to minimize dependencies
2. Comprehensive testing between phases
3. Clear documentation of progress and remaining work
4. Regular reviews to adjust phase contents if needed
