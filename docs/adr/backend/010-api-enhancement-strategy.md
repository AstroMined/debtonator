# ADR-010: API Enhancement Strategy

## Status

Accepted

## Executive Summary

This ADR establishes a phased approach for enhancing our API layer to fully expose all core application functionality across account management, bill management, bill splits, income tracking, cashflow analysis, and reporting domains. It defines consistent API design standards, implementation requirements, and a sequential enhancement strategy that maintains system stability while systematically expanding capabilities in manageable, domain-focused phases.

## Context

After a comprehensive review of our API endpoints and service layer functionality, we identified several gaps between our service capabilities and their API exposure. We need to enhance our API to ensure all core functionality is properly exposed and follows consistent patterns. Key issues include:

- Inconsistent API endpoint patterns across different domains
- Missing API endpoints for several key service capabilities
- Incomplete documentation of API contracts
- Lack of standardized approach for API enhancements
- Limited testing coverage for complex API workflows
- Inefficient error handling patterns
- Missing bulk operation support

## Decision

We will implement API enhancements through a phased approach, focusing on one domain at a time:

1. Phase 1: Account Management Enhancement
   - Statement balance history
   - Credit limit tracking
   - Transaction history
   - Balance reconciliation
   - Available credit calculation

2. Phase 2: Bill Management Expansion
   - Recurring bills endpoints
   - Auto-pay functionality
   - Bill categorization
   - Payment scheduling
   - Bulk operations

3. Phase 3: Bill Splits Optimization
   - Split validation endpoints
   - Split suggestions
   - Historical analysis
   - Bulk operations
   - Impact analysis

4. Phase 4: Income System Enhancement
   - Income categorization
   - Trends analysis
   - Deposit scheduling
   - Recurring income
   - Analysis endpoints

5. Phase 5: Cashflow Analysis Extension

   - Custom forecasts
   - Historical trends
   - Account-specific forecasts

6. Phase 6: Reporting & Analysis
   - Balance history endpoints
   - Payment patterns
   - Split analysis
   - Recommendations
   - Trend reporting

Each phase will include:

- Schema updates if needed
- Service layer enhancements
- API endpoint implementation
- Comprehensive testing
- Documentation updates

## Technical Details

### Architecture Overview

The API enhancement strategy adopts a layered approach to ensure all architectural components are properly updated:

1. **API Layer**
   - Consistent URL patterns for all endpoints
   - Proper HTTP method usage (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH)
   - Standardized parameter naming
   - Consistent response structures
   - Comprehensive OpenAPI documentation
   - Proper versioning via URL prefixes (/api/v1/...)

2. **Service Layer**
   - Enhanced service methods to support API functionality
   - Proper validation and business rule enforcement
   - Structured response mapping to API schemas

3. **Repository Layer**
   - Additional query methods to support enhanced API capabilities
   - Optimized data access patterns for API performance

4. **Schema Layer**
   - Consistent DTOs for API requests and responses
   - Enhanced validation rules
   - Proper documentation

### Data Layer

#### Models

- No direct database model changes required
- Existing models are sufficient for the enhanced API functionality
- May require additional relationship loading patterns for complex queries
- Optimize existing models for efficient data retrieval

#### Repositories

- Add specialized query methods to support enhanced API capabilities:

  ```python
  async def get_accounts_with_statements(
      self, 
      after_date: Optional[date] = None
  ) -> List[Account]:
      query = (
          select(Account)
          .outerjoin(StatementHistory)
          .options(joinedload(Account.statements))
      )
      
      if after_date:
          query = query.where(StatementHistory.statement_date >= after_date)
      
      result = await self.session.execute(query)
      return result.unique().scalars().all()
  ```

- Add pagination support for bulk operations:

  ```python
  async def get_paginated_bills(
      self,
      page: int = 1,
      items_per_page: int = 20,
      **filters
  ) -> Tuple[List[Bill], int]:
      # Calculate offset
      skip = (page - 1) * items_per_page
      
      # Count query implementation...
      # Results query implementation...
      
      return items, total
  ```

- Implement optimized transaction support for bulk operations
- Add specialized sorting and filtering capabilities

### Business Logic Layer

#### Schemas

- Create consistent request/response schemas for all endpoints:

  ```python
  class AccountStatementHistoryResponse(BaseModel):
      """Response schema for account statement history."""
      account_id: int
      statements: List[StatementHistoryResponse]
      
  class BillBulkCreateRequest(BaseModel):
      """Request schema for bulk bill creation."""
      bills: List[BillCreate]
      
  class BillBulkCreateResponse(BaseModel):
      """Response schema for bulk bill creation."""
      created_count: int
      bills: List[BillResponse]
      errors: Optional[List[Dict[str, Any]]] = None
  ```

- Implement validation rules for all request schemas
- Create consistent pagination response wrappers
- Add proper field constraints and documentation

#### Services

- Enhance service methods to support the API functionality:

  ```python
  async def get_account_with_statements(
      self,
      account_id: int,
      start_date: Optional[date] = None,
      end_date: Optional[date] = None
  ) -> Optional[Tuple[Account, List[StatementHistory]]]:
      """Get an account with its statement history."""
      account = await self.account_repository.get(account_id)
      if not account:
          return None
          
      statements = await self.statement_repository.get_by_account_id(
          account_id,
          start_date=start_date,
          end_date=end_date
      )
      
      return account, statements
  ```

- Add bulk operation support
- Implement proper error handling and validation
- Add service methods for specialized queries
- Ensure proper transaction management

### API Layer

- Implement consistent API endpoints for each domain:

  ```python
  @router.get(
      "/accounts/{account_id}/statements",
      response_model=AccountStatementHistoryResponse,
      summary="Get account statement history",
      description="Retrieve the statement history for a specific account."
  )
  async def get_account_statements(
      account_id: int,
      start_date: Optional[date] = None,
      end_date: Optional[date] = None,
      account_service: AccountService = Depends(get_account_service)
  ):
      """Get statement history for an account."""
      result = await account_service.get_account_with_statements(
          account_id,
          start_date=start_date,
          end_date=end_date
      )
      
      if not result:
          raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Account not found")
          
      account, statements = result
      
      return AccountStatementHistoryResponse(
          account_id=account.id,
          statements=[
              StatementHistoryResponse.from_orm(statement)
              for statement in statements
          ]
      )
  ```
