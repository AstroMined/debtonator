# ADR-012: Validation Layer Standardization

## Status

Implemented

## Executive Summary

This ADR establishes a three-layer validation architecture across the Debtonator platform to create a clear separation of concerns between Pydantic schemas (input/output validation), SQLAlchemy models (data persistence), and services (business logic). It eliminates validation duplication, improves error handling, enhances testability, and provides a consistent approach to data integrity throughout the application. All 18 models have been successfully refactored to comply with this standardized validation approach.

## Context

Our validation architecture had logic scattered across multiple layers:
- SQLAlchemy models using @validates decorators
- Pydantic schemas for data validation
- Business logic in models that should be in services

This created several issues:
- Unclear responsibility boundaries
- Potential for validation conflicts
- Business logic mixed with data persistence
- Harder to maintain and test
- Inconsistent validation behavior
- Duplicate validation rules
- Mixed validation approaches

Our models contained validation logic that should have been in the service layer, causing tight coupling between data persistence and business rules. Additionally, some validation was duplicated between schemas and models, creating potential for inconsistencies when one was updated but not the other.

## Decision

We will standardize our validation approach following a clear separation of concerns:

1. **Pydantic Layer (Input/Output Validation)**:
   - All data structure validation
   - Type checking
   - Field constraints
   - Format validation
   - No business logic

2. **SQLAlchemy Layer (Data Persistence)**:
   - Database constraints only (unique, foreign keys, etc.)
   - No @validates decorators
   - No business logic
   - Focus on relationships and persistence

3. **Service Layer (Business Logic)**:
   - All business rules
   - Complex calculations (like available_credit)
   - State management
   - Data consistency
   - Transaction management

This approach follows the Single Responsibility Principle, placing validation logic in the most appropriate layer based on its purpose.

## Technical Details

### Architecture Overview

The validation layer standardization creates a clear separation of concerns across the architecture:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[API Request] --> B[Pydantic Schema Validation]
    B --> C[Service Layer Business Validation]
    C --> D[Repository Layer]
    D --> E[SQLAlchemy Model Constraints]
    E --> F[Database]
    
    G[API Response] <-- H[Pydantic Response Schema]
    H <-- I[Service Layer Response Mapping]
    I <-- D
```

This architecture establishes clear boundaries:
- Pydantic handles structural validation at system boundaries
- Services contain all business logic and rules
- SQLAlchemy focuses solely on data persistence with database-level constraints
- Repositories contain no validation logic

### Data Layer

#### Models

Models are simplified to focus exclusively on data structure and relationships:

```python
class Account(BaseDBModel):
    """Account model focused on persistence"""
    __tablename__ = "accounts"
    
    id: Mapped[int] = mapped_column(primary_key=True)
    name: Mapped[str] = mapped_column(String(50), unique=True, nullable=False)
    type: Mapped[str] = mapped_column(String(20), nullable=False)
    available_balance: Mapped[Decimal] = mapped_column(Numeric(10, 2), nullable=False, default=0)
    available_credit: Mapped[Optional[Decimal]] = mapped_column(Numeric(10, 2), nullable=True)
    total_limit: Mapped[Optional[Decimal]] = mapped_column(Numeric(10, 2), nullable=True)
    
    # Relationships
    statements: Mapped[List["StatementHistory"]] = relationship(
        "StatementHistory", back_populates="account", cascade="all, delete-orphan"
    )
```

Key changes to models:
- Removed all @validates decorators
- Moved calculated properties to service layer
- Eliminated business logic methods
- Focused on clear relationship definitions
- Maintained database-level constraints
- Enhanced docstrings to clarify model purpose

#### Repositories

Repositories remain focused on data access patterns:

```python
class AccountRepository(BaseRepository[Account, int]):
    """Repository for account operations."""
    
    async def get_by_name(self, name: str) -> Optional[Account]:
        """Get account by name."""
        query = select(Account).where(Account.name == name)
        result = await self.session.execute(query)
        return result.scalars().first()
    
    async def get_with_statements(self, account_id: int) -> Optional[Account]:
        """Get account with statement history."""
        query = (
            select(Account)
            .options(selectinload(Account.statements))
            .where(Account.id == account_id)
        )
        result = await self.session.execute(query)
        return result.scalars().first()
```

Key repository patterns:
- No validation logic
- Focus on efficient data retrieval
- Relationship loading options
- Specialized query methods
- Transaction boundary support

### Business Logic Layer

#### Schemas

Schemas handle all structural validation and type conversion:

```python
class AccountBase(BaseModel):
    """Base schema for account data with enhanced validation"""
    name: str = Field(..., min_length=1, max_length=50)
    type: AccountType
    available_balance: Decimal = Field(default=0)
    total_limit: Optional[Decimal] = Field(None, ge=0)

    @field_validator("total_limit")
    @classmethod
    def validate_total_limit(cls, v: Optional[Decimal], values: Dict[str, Any]) -> Optional[Decimal]:
        """Validate that total_limit is only set for credit accounts."""
        if v is not None and values.get("type") != "credit":
            raise ValueError("Total limit can only be set for credit accounts")
        return v
        
    model_config = {
        "json_schema_extra": {
            "examples": [
                {
                    "name": "Primary Checking",
                    "type": "checking",
                    "available_balance": 1000.00
                }
            ]
        }
    }
```

Validation strategies in schemas:
- Field-level constraints with Pydantic Field
- Cross-field validation with field_validator
- Type conversion and validation
- Clear error messages
- Schema composition for inheritance
- Documentation through examples and descriptions

#### Services

Services contain all business logic and validation:

```python
class AccountService:
    """Account service with business logic"""
    
    def __init__(self, account_repository: AccountRepository):
        self.account_repository = account_repository
    
    async def update_available_credit(self, account: Account) -> None:
        """Calculate and update available credit"""
        if account.type == "credit" and account.total_limit is not None:
            account.available_credit = account.total_limit - abs(account.available_balance)
            await self.session.commit()
            await self.session.refresh(account)

    async def validate_account_update(self, account_id: int, data: AccountUpdate) -> Tuple[bool, Optional[str]]:
        """
        Validate an account update request.
        
        Business rules validated:
        - Account must exist
        - Cannot change account type
        - Credit accounts cannot have negative total_limit
        """
        account = await self.account_repository.get(account_id)
        if not account:
            return False, f"Account with ID {account_id} not found"
        
        # Validate type change
        if "type" in data.model_dump(exclude_unset=True) and data.type != account.type:
            return False, "Cannot change account type after creation"
        
        # Credit account validations
        if account.type == "credit" and "total_limit" in data.model_dump(exclude_unset=True):
            if data.total_limit < Decimal("0"):
                return False, "Credit limit cannot be negative"
            
            if account.available_balance < Decimal("0") and data.total_limit < abs(account.available_balance):
                return False, "Cannot set credit limit below current balance"
        
        return True, None

    async def update_account(self, account_id: int, data: AccountUpdate) -> Optional[Account]:
        """Update account with business logic"""
        # Validate first
        is_valid, error_message = await self.validate_account_update(account_id, data)
        if not is_valid:
            raise ValueError(error_message)
        
        # Get account
        account = await self.account_repository.get(account_id)
        if not account:
            return None

        # Update fields
        for field, value in data.model_dump(exclude_unset=True).items():
            setattr(account, field, value)

        # Apply business logic
        await self.update_available_credit(account)
        await self.session.commit()
        await self.session.refresh(account)
        return account
```

Service layer validation patterns:
- Business rule validation in dedicated methods
- Clear separation from data access logic
- Comprehensive validation before data changes
- Explicit validation methods returning status and message
- Complex business rules encapsulated in service layer
- Error messaging suitable for UI display

### API Layer

API endpoints use the service layer for validation:

```python
@router.put(
    "/accounts/{account_id}",
    response_model=AccountResponse,
    responses={
        400: {"description": "Validation error"},
        404: {"description": "Account not found"}
    }
)
async def update_account(
    account_id: int,
    account_data: AccountUpdate,
    account_service: AccountService = Depends(get_account_service)
):
    """Update an account."""
    try:
        # Service handles both validation and update
        account = await account_service.update_account(account_id, account_data)
        if not account:
            raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Account not found")
        return account
    except ValueError as e:
        # Convert business rule validation errors to appropriate HTTP response
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail=str(e))
```

API validation flow:
- Pydantic validates request structure
- Service validates business rules
- Clear error responses for validation failures
- Consistent HTTP status codes
- Comprehensive response definitions

### Frontend Considerations

- Frontend forms align with Pydantic schema validation
- Error messages from service validations are user-friendly
- Field constraints are consistent between frontend and backend
- Documentation provides clear validation expectations
- Client libraries generated from OpenAPI specifications include validation

### Config, Utils, and Cross-Cutting Concerns

- Created validation utility functions for common patterns
- Implemented consistent error handling approach
- Standardized validation error messages
- Added validation documentation
- Created testing utilities for validation cases

### Dependencies and External Systems

- Pydantic V2 for schema validation
- SQLAlchemy 2.0+ for model definitions
- FastAPI for API validation integration
- No external validation systems required

### Implementation Impact
