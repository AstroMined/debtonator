## Completion Criteria

To consider ADR-029 fully implemented, all of the following must be true:

1. All tests are passing, including the previously failing tests
2. The implementation follows the registry pattern established in the `src/registry` module
3. No hardcoded string matching remains in any transaction category handling
4. The TransactionReferenceRegistry implements the singleton pattern correctly
5. All services properly integrate with the registry through constructor initialization
6. Documentation is complete and comprehensive in README.md files and docstrings
7. The CategoryMatcher service correctly handles hierarchical categories
8. The implementation has been reviewed and approved as having zero technical debt

## Dependencies

- Existing CategoryRepository implementation with proper inheritance
- Existing registry pattern in `src/registry/account_types.py` (for reference)
- BaseService pattern for CategoryMatcher implementation

## Risks and Mitigations

- **Risk**: Performance impact of hierarchical category matching
  - **Mitigation**: Implement efficient caching strategies in CategoryRepository

- **Risk**: Changes affecting multiple services simultaneously
  - **Mitigation**: Thorough testing and complete implementation from the start

- **Risk**: Complexity increase with additional abstractions
  - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive documentation and concrete examples

## Implementation Notes

1. Follow the singleton registry pattern established for `account_type_registry`
2. Use clean implementation without temporary compatibility layers
3. Prioritize fixing root cause issues rather than symptoms
4. Use proper error handling and comprehensive logging throughout
5. Follow established naming conventions and code style
6. Ensure proper dependency injection for testability
