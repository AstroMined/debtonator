# ADR-014 Repository Implementation Progress

## Completed Tasks

1. **Create Unit Tests for BaseRepository**
   - Created `tests/unit/repositories/test_base_repository.py`
   - Implemented tests for all CRUD operations
   - Tested pagination, relationship loading, and transactions
   - Used real database fixtures and schema validation

2. **Refactor AccountService to Use Repository Pattern**
   - Updated `src/services/accounts.py` to use repository pattern
   - Implemented dependency injection with repositories
   - Maintained all existing functionality with improved architecture
   - Added proper schema validation flow

3. **Added Required Repository Methods**
   - Added `get_by_account_ordered` to StatementHistoryRepository
   - Added `get_by_account_ordered` to CreditLimitHistoryRepository
   - Added transaction-specific methods to TransactionHistoryRepository

4. **Updated Service Tests**
   - Updated `tests/integration/services/test_account_service.py`
   - Used real repositories with database fixtures
   - Added tests for new functionality like retrieving history

5. **Created Documentation**
   - Created `docs/adr/implementation/service_repository_integration.md`
   - Documented consistent patterns for service-repository integration
   - Included examples of dependency injection, transaction management, and testing

## Next Steps

1. **Implement Tests for Remaining Services**
   - Apply the same refactoring pattern to other service tests
   - Ensure all tests use real repositories with proper fixtures
   - Follow the Arrange-Schema-Act-Assert pattern consistently

2. **Refactor Remaining Services**
   - Apply the repository pattern to all services
   - Start with core services like BillService and PaymentService
   - Ensure proper validation flow in all services

3. **Complete API Dependency Updates**
   - Update all API endpoint dependencies to use the new service pattern
   - Create dedicated service provider functions in `src/api/dependencies/services.py`
   - Update API tests to use the refactored services

4. **Create Repository Exceptions**
   - Implement custom exception types for repository operations
   - Add error translation in services
   - Update tests to verify error handling

## Implementation Approach

1. **Service-by-Service Implementation**
   - Refactor each service and its tests independently
   - Ensure thorough test coverage for each service
   - Apply consistent patterns across all services

2. **API Endpoint Update**
   - Update API endpoints to use the refactored services
   - Verify with integration tests
   - Update API documentation if needed

3. **Advanced Features**
   - Add transaction boundaries for multi-operation services
   - Implement repository-specific exception handling
   - Enhance repository query methods as needed

## Performance Considerations

1. **Minimize Database Queries**
   - Use relationship loading appropriately (selectinload/joinedload)
   - Implement specialized query methods for common operations
   - Consider adding caching for repository results

2. **Transaction Management**
   - Use transaction context managers for multi-operation services
   - Ensure proper error handling and rollback
   - Test with simulated failures

## Testing Strategy

1. **Full Integration Testing**
   - Use real database fixtures for all tests
   - Validate through Pydantic schemas
   - Test error handling and edge cases

2. **Coverage Goals**
   - 100% coverage for repository methods
   - 100% coverage for service business logic
   - Comprehensive test cases for validation logic
