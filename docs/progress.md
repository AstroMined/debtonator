   - Add POST /accounts/banking endpoint
   - Implement POST /accounts/bnpl/{account_id}/update-status endpoint
   - Create endpoints to retrieve available account types
   - Add feature flag integration to API endpoints
   - Create OpenAPI documentation

2. __Implement Error Handling System (0%)__
   - Create account-specific error hierarchy in errors/ module
   - Implement AccountError base class and specialized subclasses
   - Add feature flag-related error classes
   - Create consistent error formatting across layers
   - Implement error translation between layers
   - Add user-friendly error messages to API responses

3. __Fix Remaining Pydantic v2 Discriminator Issues (20%)__
   - Address validator conflict with discriminator fields in account type response models
   - Ensure proper handling of field validators in discriminated unions
   - Move additional validation logic to service layer where needed
   - Create comprehensive test cases for polymorphic validation
   - Add pattern documentation for schema-service validation split

4. __Complete Schema Factory Development (45%)__
   - Implement schema factories for remaining account types
   - Add support for customization via kwargs

## Known Issues

1. __Pydantic v2 Discriminator Field Validator Conflict__
   - Some account type response models still have validators on the discriminator field
   - This causes validation errors with Pydantic v2's discriminated union implementation
   - Need to move those validators to the service layer following the established pattern
   - This issue affects API integration tests and polymorphic response serialization

2. __Repository Error Handling__
   - Need to implement custom repository exceptions
   - Error translation in services needs to be standardized
   - Exception hierarchy should be consistent across the application

3. __Schema Factory Parameter Alignment__
   - Some schema factory functions include parameters not in the final schema
   - Need to add clear documentation for all schema factories about field usage
   - Consider standardizing parameter patterns across all schema factories
