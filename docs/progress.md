### Completed Tasks
- Refactored integration test fixtures by moving them from individual test files to shared conftest.py
- Organized fixtures by category (repository fixtures, account fixtures, liability fixtures, etc.)
- Removed duplicate fixture definitions to avoid conflicts

## Known Issues

1. **UTC Datetime Handling**
   - Some naive datetime usage still exists in repository tests
   - Need to implement datetime helper utilities in production code
   - Need standardized approach for comparing database return values
   - Current scanner implementation still produces some false positives

2. **Repository Error Handling**
   - Need to implement custom repository exceptions
   - Error translation in services needs to be standardized
   - Exception hierarchy should be consistent across the application

3. **Account Type Handling**
   - Field naming inconsistency (`type` vs `account_type`)
   - Parameter mapping in schema factories creates confusion
   - Inconsistent schema creation in tests
   - These issues will be addressed in the upcoming account type expansion (ADR-016)
