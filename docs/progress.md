   - Add tests for complex nested objects with proper validation
   - Create test files for account-type specific factories
   - Improve test coverage for boundary conditions and edge cases
   - Verify proper validation of discriminated union fields

   - Implement error handling middleware for API endpoints
   - Add comprehensive documentation for error handling patterns

4. __Fix Remaining Pydantic v2 Discriminator Issues (20%)__
   - Address validator conflict with discriminator fields in account type response models
   - Ensure proper handling of field validators in discriminated unions
   - Move additional validation logic to service layer where needed

   - Add training materials for feature flag usage

## Known Issues

1. __Pydantic v2 Discriminator Field Validator Conflict__
   - Some account type response models still have validators on the discriminator field
   - This causes validation errors with Pydantic v2's discriminated union implementation
   - Need to move those validators to the service layer following the established pattern
   - This issue affects API integration tests and polymorphic response serialization

2. __Repository Error Handling__
   - Need to implement custom repository exceptions
   - Error translation in services needs to be standardized
   - Exception hierarchy should be consistent across the application

3. __Schema Factory Parameter Alignment__
   - Some schema factory functions include parameters not in the final schema
   - Need to add clear documentation for all schema factories about field usage
   - Consider standardizing parameter patterns across all schema factories
   
4. __Complex Nested Schema Structures__
   - Schemas with multi-level nesting like Dict[str, Dict[str, Object]] require careful handling
   - Need to document expected structure for complex nested objects
   - Test coverage for nested object validation should be improved
   - Some schema factory implementations don't match the schema structure

5. __Error Module Coverage Gaps__
   - Small coverage gaps remain in src/errors/__init__.py (lines 98-99, 105-107)
   - These are exception handlers for import errors that are difficult to test without mocks
   - One branch in src/errors/credit.py (line 64) remains untested
   - These gaps are acceptable for now and can be addressed in integration tests
