## Known Issues

1. __Critical Polymorphic Identity Issues in Account Type Repositories__
   - SQLAlchemy warnings: "Flushing object with incompatible polymorphic identity"
   - Repository methods creating base `Account` objects instead of specialized types
   - Tests failing with incorrect `isinstance()` checks against returned objects
   - Incorrect SQLAlchemy session handling not detaching objects properly
   - Account type registry not being used as source of truth
   - Improper polymorphic loading in `create_typed_account` and `update_typed_account`
   - Feature flag validation bypassed in some test flows
   - Timezone inconsistency with offset-naive vs offset-aware datetimes
   - Solution requires careful refactoring of repository layer methods with proper polymorphic identity handling
   - Need to ensure proper use of model classes from registry with explicit model class querying

2. __Pydantic v2 Discriminator Field Validator Conflict__
   - Some account type response models still have validators on the discriminator field
   - This causes validation errors with Pydantic v2's discriminated union implementation
   - Need to move those validators to the service layer following the established pattern
   - This issue affects API integration tests and polymorphic response serialization

2. __Repository Error Handling__
   - Need to implement custom repository exceptions
   - Error translation in services needs to be standardized
   - Exception hierarchy should be consistent across the application

3. __Schema Factory Parameter Alignment__
   - Some schema factory functions include parameters not in the final schema
   - Need to add clear documentation for all schema factories about field usage
   - Consider standardizing parameter patterns across all schema factories
   
4. __Complex Nested Schema Structures__
   - Schemas with multi-level nesting like Dict[str, Dict[str, Object]] require careful handling
   - Need to document expected structure for complex nested objects
   - Test coverage for nested object validation should be improved
   - Some schema factory implementations don't match the schema structure

5. __Decimal Sum Validation in Tests__
   - Some tests for decimal sums in complex structures require tolerance ranges
   - Day of month patterns in seasonality analysis sum to 0.94 instead of 1.0
   - Similar issues exist in other probability distribution tests
   - Solution is to use appropriate tolerance ranges in tests
   - Need standardized approach to decimal equality testing

6. __Cross-Layer Concerns in Utils Module__
   - The db.py module crosses layers between database and HTTP concerns
   - Should move functionality to src/errors/ for better separation of concerns
   - Some feature_flags functionality requires integration tests rather than unit tests
   - Need to document cross-layer concerns for future refactoring
