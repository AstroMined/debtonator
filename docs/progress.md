## What Works

1. **Account & Transaction Management**
   - Dynamic account management with multiple account types
   - Balance and credit limit tracking
   - Transaction history with proper decimal precision
   - Statement balance history tracking
   - Repository-based account service with improved architecture

2. **Bill Management**
   - Bill tracking with due dates and payment status
   - Split payment support across multiple accounts
   - Payment tracking with source allocation
   - Auto-pay management

3. **Financial Analysis**
   - Cross-account balance tracking
   - Financial forecasting with minimum calculations
   - Income requirement projections
   - Tax consideration in calculations

4. **Schema Validation**
   - Consistent field validation across all schemas
   - Proper UTC timezone handling for all datetime fields
   - Decimal precision validation for monetary values
   - Cross-field validation for data consistency

5. **Core Architecture**
   - Repository pattern for data access
   - Service layer with business logic isolation
   - API response formatting with proper precision
   - Version management for semantic versioning
   - Repository-service integration pattern established
   - Schema factories for efficient test data creation

## What's Left to Build

1. **Repository Layer Implementation**: COMPLETED (100%) ✓
   - All 18 core repositories implemented
   - All 5 additional repositories implemented
   - All dependency injection functions in place
   - Next steps: Create tests and integrate with service layer

2. **Repository Integration Tests (98%)**
   - ✓ Fixed UTC datetime handling in transaction_history_repository
   - ✓ Resolved SQLAlchemy ORM update pattern issues
   - ✓ Fixed transaction_type constraint issues
   - ✓ Fixed credit_limit_history_repository schema validation
   - ✓ Aligned schema requirements with database constraints
   - ✓ Fixed BalanceReconciliation schema to match database NOT NULL constraints
   - ✓ Fixed BaseRepository transaction handling with nested transaction support
   - Implement comprehensive timezone handling in repository tests
   - Fix date_trunc function missing in SQLite for monthly totals

3. **Service Layer Refactoring (90%)**
   - ✓ AccountService refactored to use repository pattern
   - Refactor remaining services (BillService, PaymentService, etc.)
   - Update API endpoints to use refactored services
   - Ensure proper schema validation in service-to-repository flow

4. **API Enhancement Project - Phase 6 (100%)**
   - Implement recommendations API
   - Develop trend reporting features
   - Create frontend components
   - Build comprehensive API documentation

5. **Mobile Access Features (100%)**
   - Create mobile-responsive UI components
   - Implement offline capabilities
   - Add notification system

## Known Issues

1. **Repository Implementation Completion**
   - All repositories are now implemented (18/18 core, 5/5 additional)
   - Focus on testing new repositories according to established patterns
   - Need schema factory tests for new model types
   - Implementation parity achieved across all repositories

2. **Repository Tests**
   - Need tests for newly implemented repositories
   - Ensure Arrange-Schema-Act-Assert pattern is followed
   - Create schema factories for PaymentSchedule and DepositSchedule
   - Test relationship loading behavior with nested resources

3. **Service Layer Architecture**
   - In progress: Refactoring services to use repository pattern
   - AccountService refactored as proof of concept
   - Remaining services will follow the established pattern
   - Dependency injection framework in place

4. **Repository Error Handling**
   - Need to implement custom repository exceptions
   - Error translation in services needs to be standardized
   - Exception hierarchy should be consistent across the application

5. **SQLAlchemy ORM Update Patterns**
   - Identified and fixed issues with updated_at timestamps not updating properly
   - Need to ensure proper ORM update pattern usage across all repositories
   - Improved documentation needed for SQLAlchemy best practices

6. **Timezone Handling in Repository Tests**
   - Inconsistent datetime comparison between timezone-aware and naive datetimes
   - Need standardized approach for comparing database return values
   - Apply ADR-011 principles consistently across all repositories
   - Repository test cases need updates for proper datetime handling
