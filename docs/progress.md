# Progress: Debtonator

## Current Priority: Schema Modularization and Test Implementation

### Recent Improvements
1. **Cashflow Schema Tests Completed** ✓
   - Implemented all five test files for modularized cashflow schemas:
     * `tests/schemas/test_cashflow_base_schemas.py` - Core cashflow schemas tests
     * `tests/schemas/test_cashflow_metrics_schemas.py` - Financial metrics schemas tests
     * `tests/schemas/test_cashflow_account_analysis_schemas.py` - Account analysis schemas tests
     * `tests/schemas/test_cashflow_forecasting_schemas.py` - Forecasting schemas tests
     * `tests/schemas/test_cashflow_historical_schemas.py` - Historical analysis schemas tests
   - Each test file includes:
     * Tests for valid object creation with required and optional fields
     * Tests for field validations (required fields, constraints)
     * Tests for decimal precision validation for monetary fields
     * Tests for UTC datetime validation per ADR-011
     * Tests for business rules and cross-field validations
     * Tests for BaseSchemaValidator inheritance
   - Updated schema_test_implementation_checklist.md to reflect completed work
   - All tests passing with comprehensive validation coverage

2. **Timezone Compliance Fixes** ✓
   - Fixed timezone handling in test files to comply with ADR-011:
     * Updated `tests/schemas/test_accounts_schemas.py` to use `timezone.utc` instead of `ZoneInfo("UTC")`
     * Ensured proper UTC datetime handling across all tests
     * Added proper import statements (`from datetime import timezone`)
     * Maintained `ZoneInfo` import for non-UTC timezone tests
   - Updated schema test implementation checklist to track timezone compliance
   - Ensured consistent timezone approach aligned with ADR-011 requirements

3. **Schema Modularization Completed** ✓
   - Decomposed large cashflow.py file (974 lines) into five focused modules:
     * `src/schemas/cashflow/base.py` - Core cashflow schemas
     * `src/schemas/cashflow/metrics.py` - Financial metrics schemas
     * `src/schemas/cashflow/account_analysis.py` - Account analysis schemas
     * `src/schemas/cashflow/forecasting.py` - Forecasting schemas
     * `src/schemas/cashflow/historical.py` - Historical analysis schemas
   - Created backward-compatible re-export mechanism via `__init__.py`
   - Maintained all ADR-011 and ADR-012 compliance throughout
   - Improved code organization for better maintainability
   - Enhanced adherence to Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
   - Updated schema_test_implementation_checklist.md to reflect new structure
   - Updated test implementation plan to target the modular structure

     * test_realtime_cashflow_schemas.py with comprehensive test coverage
     * test_recommendations_schemas.py with thorough validation tests
     * test_income_categories_schemas.py with complete CRUD schema tests
   - Each test file includes consistent test patterns:
     * Tests for valid object creation with required and optional fields
     * Tests for field validations (required fields, constraints)
     * Tests for decimal precision on monetary fields
     * Tests for UTC datetime validation per ADR-011
     * Tests for business logic validations and cross-field validation
     * Verification of BaseSchemaValidator inheritance

5. **Version Update** ✓
   - Bumped version from 0.3.95 to 0.4.0 to reflect schema reorganization
   - Updated both version.py and pyproject.toml for consistency

     * Made the function backward compatible with dictionary-style validation context
     * Added proper error handling for different validation context types
     * Fixed related test failures across schema test files
     * Improved robustness against future Pydantic changes
   - Fixed schema test error patterns:
     * Updated test patterns for validation errors to match Pydantic v2 format
     * Fixed test_bulk_operation_validation in test_bill_splits_schemas.py
     * Updated assertion patterns to match new error message formats
