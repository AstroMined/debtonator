## Previous Updates

## March 23, 2025

### Completed Tasks
- Refactored integration test fixtures by moving them from individual test files to shared conftest.py

## What's Left to Build

1. **PaymentSource Schema Simplification (ADR-017) (0%)**
   - Follow the implementation plan in ADR-017
   - Simplify schema architecture to eliminate dual approach
   - Update repository methods to handle parent-child relationships
   - Update tests to use the simplified approach
   - Remove technical debt from payment source creation

2. **UTC Datetime Compliance (98%)**
   - ✓ Created helper utilities in tests/helpers/datetime_utils.py
   - ✓ Implemented scanner script in tools/scan_naive_datetimes.py
   - ✓ Added pytest hook for warning about naive datetime usage
   - ✓ Created comprehensive documentation for datetime compliance
   - ✓ Fixed most incorrect datetime usage in repository tests
   - ✓ Improved test helper utilization in schema tests
   - ✓ Fixed datetime comparison issues in update operations
   - Fix remaining naive datetime usage in tests
   - Add scanner to CI pipeline
   - Consider expanding helper utilities to production code

3. **Service Layer Refactoring (10%)**
   - ✓ AccountService refactored to use repository pattern
   - Refactor remaining services (BillService, PaymentService, etc.)
   - Update API endpoints to use refactored services
   - Ensure proper schema validation in service-to-repository flow

4. **Account Type Expansion (ADR-016) (0%)**
   - Implement field naming consistency (`type` → `account_type`)
   - Fix parameter mapping inconsistencies in schema factories
   - Create consistent schema creation patterns in tests
   - Expand account type options with comprehensive validation
   - Enhance API documentation for account types

## Known Issues

1. **UTC Datetime Handling**
   - Some naive datetime usage still exists in repository tests
   - Need to implement datetime helper utilities in production code
   - Need standardized approach for comparing database return values
   - Current scanner implementation still produces some false positives

2. **Repository Error Handling**
   - Need to implement custom repository exceptions
   - Error translation in services needs to be standardized
   - Exception hierarchy should be consistent across the application

3. **Account Type Handling**
   - Field naming inconsistency (`type` vs `account_type`)
   - Parameter mapping in schema factories creates confusion
   - Inconsistent schema creation in tests
   - These issues will be addressed in the upcoming account type expansion (ADR-016)

4. **PaymentSource Schema Architecture**
   - Dual schema approach creates confusion and technical debt
   - Circular dependency potential between Payment and PaymentSource
   - These issues will be addressed by implementing ADR-017
