### Previous Improvements
1. **Reverted ConstrainedDecimal Implementation Due to Pydantic V2 Incompatibility** ✓
   - Identified critical compatibility issue with our decimal precision implementation:
     * The `ConstrainedDecimal` class used in our implementation has been removed in Pydantic V2
     * This caused import errors that broke the application completely
     * Needed immediate action to restore application functionality
   - Implemented a clean solution to restore functionality:
     * Used `git reset --hard f31eb74` to revert to previous working commit
     * Verified application functionality was restored
     * Created a new implementation plan compatible with Pydantic V2
   - Analyzed root cause and documented the incompatibility:
     * `ConstrainedDecimal` and other "constrained" classes were removed entirely
     * Pydantic V2 recommends using Annotated types with Field constraints instead
     * This required a complete redesign of our validation approach
   - Created a comprehensive implementation plan for moving forward:
     * Created `docs/adr/compliance/adr013_implementation_checklist_v2.md` with the new approach
     * Prioritized a phased implementation strategy
     * Reset progress tracking for components that need revision
     * Maintained progress for components that don't need changes (DB schema, Core Module)
   - Provided a reference implementation:
     * Created `docs/adr/compliance/annotated_types_reference.py` with examples
     * Demonstrated proper use of Annotated types with Field constraints
     * Included examples for dictionary validation
     * Provided sample schema classes
   - Updated ADR-013 to document the revised approach:
     * Added a new "Implementation Revision" section
     * Updated code samples with the Annotated types approach
     * Added a new revision entry (3.0) for the Pydantic V2 compatibility changes
     * Added details about dictionary validation strategy

2. **Developed Enhanced Dictionary Validation Strategy** ✓
   - Identified potential validation gap with dictionary fields:
     * Dictionary values containing decimals needed special handling
     * Simple type aliases like `MoneyDict = Dict[str, MoneyDecimal]` might not validate properly
     * Nested dictionaries presented additional validation challenges
   - Developed a robust dictionary validation strategy:
     * Implemented a `validate_decimal_dictionaries` model validator
     * Created specialized validation for MoneyDict and PercentageDict types
     * Added proper error messages for validation failures
     * Ensured dictionary validation works across nested structures
   - Created a comprehensive reference implementation:
     * Demonstrated proper validation techniques for dictionaries
     * Included handling for Integer-keyed dictionaries (e.g., account IDs)
     * Added detailed documentation for validation behavior
   - This strategy addresses a significant risk area in the implementation:
     * Dictionary validation is more complex than simple field validation
     * JSON deserialization required special handling
     * Nested structures needed proper validation cascading
     * In-place dictionary modifications needed validation

3. **Created Implementation Plan for Pydantic V2 Compatibility** ✓
   - Developed a comprehensive, phased implementation approach:
     * Phase 1: Core Type Definitions with Annotated types
     * Phase 2: Dictionary Validation Strategy implementation
     * Phase 3: Schema Updates to use new types
     * Phase 4: Test Updates for new validation behavior
     * Phases 5-8: Service Tests, Documentation, Integration, QA
   - Created a detailed progress tracking system:
     * Reset progress for schema files, BaseSchemaValidator, tests
     * Maintained progress for database schema, models, core module
     * Added a new implementation area for Dictionary Validation
     * Updated overall progress tracking (66% complete)
   - Defined clear action items for each phase:
     * Listed specific files to update and changes needed
     * Provided code examples for the new approach
     * Prioritized critical components
     * Added validation strategy for dictionaries
   - This comprehensive plan provides a clear path forward:
     * Maintains the same validation goals as the original ADR
     * Uses a Pydantic V2-compatible approach
     * Addresses potential validation gaps
     * Includes comprehensive testing strategy

4. **Fixed Parameter Passing in Cashflow Schema Files** ✓
   - Fixed corrupted `src/schemas/cashflow/base.py` file:
     * Restored proper indentation and structure
     * Fixed field definitions using proper keyword arguments for BaseSchemaValidator.money_field()

     * Fixed `src/schemas/cashflow/historical.py` to use keyword parameters
     * Changed all instances of positional arguments to named keyword arguments
   - Fixed parameter mismatch in BaseSchemaValidator.money_field() calls:
     * The method expected field description as a single positional parameter followed by kwargs
     * All calls now properly use `default=...` for default values
     * Standardized approach across all schema files
   - Fixed test file corruption:
     * Repaired `tests/unit/schemas/test_accounts_schemas.py` which had duplicated content
     * Fixed a syntax error with imports appearing after function definition
     * Restored proper structure with imports at the beginning of file
   - These fixes ensure consistent parameter passing across all schema files:
     * All money_field() calls now use proper keyword arguments
     * Percentage_field() calls use the same pattern for consistency
     * Test files correctly validate the behavior of these fields
     * Removed error about "2 positional arguments but 3 were given"
