# Progress: Debtonator

## Current Priority: Schema Modularization and Test Implementation

### Recent Improvements
1. **Implemented Centralized Decimal Precision Approach** ✓
   - Enhanced core components with standardized approach:
     * Updated `DecimalPrecision` core module with additional utilities like `validate_sum_equals_total()`
     * Enhanced `BaseSchemaValidator` with field creation methods (`money_field()` and `percentage_field()`)
     * Improved validation to properly handle both standard and special case precision requirements
   - Implemented in key schema files:
     * Updated `src/schemas/accounts.py` with standardized money fields
     * Updated `src/schemas/cashflow/account_analysis.py` with proper handling of:
       * Standard monetary fields (2 decimal places)
       * Special case percentage fields (4 decimal places)
     * Successfully implemented the special case handling for percentage fields
   - Updated documentation:
     * Enhanced ADR-013 with implementation details of centralized approach
     * Updated implementation checklist with completed items and next steps
     * Added quality assurance steps for different field types
   - This centralized approach provides significant benefits:
     * Reduced code duplication across schema files
     * Consistent field definitions and validation behavior
     * Proper handling of special cases without custom validators
     * Clear separation between precision utilities and schema validation
     * Minimized code fragmentation with two well-defined locations

2. **Schema Test Timezone and Error Message Fixes** ✓
   - Fixed several issues across schema test files:
     * Fixed timezone creation in balance_history_schemas.py using proper `timezone(timedelta(hours=5))` pattern
     * Updated error message patterns in accounts_schemas.py to match Pydantic's actual messages
     * Fixed decimal precision test in recommendations_schemas.py to match singular message
     * Updated transaction_schemas.py to use consistent "Datetime must be UTC" error messages
     * Fixed date validation in liabilities_schemas.py with dynamic future dates
     * Updated payment validation tests to reflect that future dates are now allowed
     * Fixed string/list validation tests in recommendations_schemas.py
   - Fixed all 11 failing tests and ensured:
     * Proper timezone handling with `timezone.utc` instead of `ZoneInfo("UTC")`
     * Corrected non-UTC timezone creation syntax
     * Consistent error message patterns aligned with actual Pydantic behavior
     * Fixed potential future test failures from hardcoded dates
     * Tests properly validating current schema behaviors

     * Proper timezone conversion preserves the original time value
     * Full compliance with ADR-011 for all datetime fields
     * Improved test stability across timezone boundaries
   - Fixed critical issue where:
     * default_factory=datetime.now was creating naive datetimes
