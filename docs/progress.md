   - ~~Update all calls to repository factory methods to use await~~
   - ~~Fix repository fixtures to properly handle async factory methods~~

3. __Pydantic v2 Discriminator Field Validator Conflict__
   - Some account type response models still have validators on the discriminator field
   - This causes validation errors with Pydantic v2's discriminated union implementation
   - Need to move those validators to the service layer following the established pattern
   - This issue affects API integration tests and polymorphic response serialization

4. __Repository Error Handling__
   - Need to implement custom repository exceptions
   - Error translation in services needs to be standardized
   - Exception hierarchy should be consistent across the application

5. __Schema Factory Parameter Alignment__
   - Some schema factory functions include parameters not in the final schema
   - Need to add clear documentation for all schema factories about field usage
   - Consider standardizing parameter patterns across all schema factories
   
6. __Complex Nested Schema Structures__
   - Schemas with multi-level nesting like Dict[str, Dict[str, Object]] require careful handling
   - Need to document expected structure for complex nested objects
   - Test coverage for nested object validation should be improved
   - Some schema factory implementations don't match the schema structure

7. __Decimal Sum Validation in Tests__
   - Some tests for decimal sums in complex structures require tolerance ranges
   - Day of month patterns in seasonality analysis sum to 0.94 instead of 1.0
   - Similar issues exist in other probability distribution tests
   - Solution is to use appropriate tolerance ranges in tests
   - Need standardized approach to decimal equality testing

8. __Cross-Layer Concerns in Utils Module__
   - The db.py module crosses layers between database and HTTP concerns
   - Should move functionality to src/errors/ for better separation of concerns
   - Some feature_flags functionality requires integration tests rather than unit tests
   - Need to document cross-layer concerns for future refactoring

9. ~~__Schema Validation Flow Inconsistencies__~~ RESOLVED ✓
   - ~~Some schemas mix field and model validation responsibilities~~
   - ~~Need to standardize validation approach across all schemas~~
   - ~~Improve error messages for validation failures~~
   - ~~Document validation patterns for consistent implementation~~

10. ~~__Bill Split Transaction Boundary Testing__~~ COMPLETED ✓
    - ~~Need to add more comprehensive tests for transaction boundaries~~
    - ~~Ensure rollback works correctly for all failure scenarios~~
    - ~~Test validation for non-existent accounts and other edge cases~~
    - ~~Verify proper automatic primary account split creation~~
