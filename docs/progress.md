## Known Issues

1. **UTC Datetime Handling**
   - Some naive datetime usage still exists in repository tests
   - Need to implement datetime helper utilities in production code
   - Need standardized approach for comparing database return values
   - Current scanner implementation still produces some false positives

2. **Repository Implementation Completion**
   - All repositories are now implemented (18/18 core, 5/5 additional) ✓
   - Integration tests implemented for all new repositories ✓
   - Schema factories created for all model types ✓
   - Implementation parity achieved across all repositories ✓

3. **Repository Tests**
   - Tests implemented for all repositories (23/23) ✓
   - Arrange-Schema-Act-Assert pattern implemented across all tests ✓
   - Schema factories created and utilized for all repository tests ✓
   - Relationship loading behavior tested with nested resources ✓
   - Model-specific repository tests refactored (7/23) ✓
   - Comprehensive validation error tests implemented ✓
   - Payment schema factories enhanced for better test support ✓
   - Bulk operation testing patterns standardized ✓
   - Transaction boundary testing implemented ✓

4. **Service Layer Architecture**
   - In progress: Refactoring services to use repository pattern
   - AccountService refactored as proof of concept
   - Remaining services will follow the established pattern
   - Dependency injection framework in place

5. **Repository Error Handling**
   - Need to implement custom repository exceptions
   - Error translation in services needs to be standardized
   - Exception hierarchy should be consistent across the application

6. **SQLAlchemy ORM Update Patterns**
   - Identified and fixed issues with updated_at timestamps not updating properly
   - Need to ensure proper ORM update pattern usage across all repositories
   - Improved documentation needed for SQLAlchemy best practices

7. **Account Type Handling**
   - Field naming inconsistency (`type` vs `account_type`)
   - Parameter mapping in schema factories creates confusion
   - Inconsistent schema creation in tests
   - These issues will be addressed in the upcoming account type expansion (ADR-016)
