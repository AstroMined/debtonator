# Progress

## March 26, 2025

### Completed Tasks

- Fixed SQLAlchemy Union Query ORM Mapping Loss:
  - Fixed 'int' object has no attribute 'primary_account_id' error in LiabilityRepository
  - Discovered and documented common issue with SQL UNION operations causing ORM mapping loss
  - Implemented sustainable two-step query pattern to preserve entity mapping
  - First: Collect IDs from separate queries for primary accounts and bill splits
  - Second: Make a final query using ID list to retrieve full entity objects
  - Used Liability.id.in_(combined_ids) pattern instead of direct UNION
  - Documented pattern as a best practice for handling complex query combinations
  - Added additional defensive handling for empty result sets
  - Updated test failure resolution plan with this new pattern
  - Made test_get_bills_for_account pass in test_liability_repository_advanced.py
  - Fixed test_get_bills_due_in_range in test_liability_repository_advanced.py

- Refactored test fixtures to eliminate circular dependencies:
  - Updated 6 fixture files (income, payments, recurring, schedules, statements, transactions)
  - Replaced repository-based fixture creation with direct SQLAlchemy model instantiation
  - Fixed field name mismatches across all fixture files (`old_limit`/`new_limit` → `credit_limit`, `account_type` → `type`, etc.)
  - Removed `balance_after` and other non-existent fields from TransactionHistory
  - Improved SQLAlchemy relationship handling with proper flush-refresh patterns
  - Fixed datetime handling to consistently use naive datetime objects for database storage
  - Enhanced architecture layer separation by removing business logic from repositories
  - Improved test isolation by removing dependencies on the systems they test
  - Fixed several test errors related to field mismatches and type issues

### Next Steps

- Apply Union Query Pattern to Similar Repository Methods:
  - Check payment_repository methods for similar UNION issues
  - Apply two-step query pattern to recurring_bill_repository where needed
  - Fix any other repositories that might have ORM mapping loss with UNION queries
  - Ensure all repository return types match actual returned data types
  - Add defensive handling for empty result sets consistently

- Continue Phase 2: Database Integrity Issues
  - Fix NOT NULL constraint failures in category_repository_advanced tests
  - Fix relationship loading issues in remaining repository tests
  - Fix assertion issues in recurring_bill_repository_advanced
  - Fix category-income relationships in income_category_repository_advanced

- Fix remaining repository tests to work with the direct model instantiation approach
- Create ADR documenting the test fixture architecture for future reference
- Continue Phase 3-5 of test failure resolution

## Known Issues

1. **SQLAlchemy Union Query Mapping Loss**
   - Union operations in complex ORM mappings can cause loss of entity mapping
   - Need to check other repositories for similar issues
   - Problem especially appears with UNION operations that join across relationships
   - Two-step query pattern (collect IDs, then query by ID) is the proper solution

1. **UTC Datetime Handling**
   - Some naive datetime usage still exists in repository tests outside Phase 1
   - Need to implement datetime helper utilities in production code
   - Need to add scanner to CI pipeline
   - Current scanner implementation still produces some false positives

2. **Repository Error Handling**
   - Need to implement custom repository exceptions
   - Error translation in services needs to be standardized
   - Exception hierarchy should be consistent across the application

3. **Account Type Handling**
   - Field naming inconsistency (`type` vs `account_type`)
   - Parameter mapping in schema factories creates confusion
   - Inconsistent schema creation in tests

4. **PaymentSource Schema Architecture**
   - Dual schema approach creates confusion and technical debt
   - Circular dependency potential between Payment and PaymentSource

5. **Repository Test Updates**
   - Some tests may still expect repository-based fixture creation
   - Field name mismatches in assertions need to be fixed
   - Some tests may reference fields that no longer exist in fixtures
