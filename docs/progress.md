## What Works

1. **Account & Transaction Management**
   - Dynamic account management with multiple account types
   - Balance and credit limit tracking
   - Transaction history with proper decimal precision
   - Statement balance history tracking
   - Repository-based account service with improved architecture

2. **Bill Management**
   - Bill tracking with due dates and payment status
   - Split payment support across multiple accounts
   - Payment tracking with source allocation
   - Auto-pay management

3. **Financial Analysis**
   - Cross-account balance tracking
   - Financial forecasting with minimum calculations
   - Income requirement projections
   - Tax consideration in calculations

4. **Schema Validation**
   - Consistent field validation across all schemas
   - Proper UTC timezone handling for all datetime fields
   - Decimal precision validation for monetary values
   - Cross-field validation for data consistency

5. **Core Architecture**
   - Repository pattern for data access
   - Service layer with business logic isolation
   - API response formatting with proper precision
   - Version management for semantic versioning
   - Repository-service integration pattern established

## What's Left to Build

1. **Schema Factory Pattern (85%)**
   - ✓ Removed schema factories backward compatibility
   - ✓ Enhanced base utilities with improved decorators and constants
   - ✓ Standardized factory function implementation with decorator pattern
   - ✓ Fixed CreditLimitHistoryUpdate to include required effective_date
   - ✓ Added comprehensive documentation and migration guide
   - ✓ Added new factories for 6 additional schema types:
     - Balance History
     - Income (regular and recurring)
     - Statement History
     - Recurring Bills
     - Deposit Schedules
     - Income Categories
   - Update existing tests to use direct imports from domain modules
   - Create additional factories for remaining schema types

2. **Repository Integration Tests (98%)**
   - ✓ Fixed UTC datetime handling in transaction_history_repository
   - ✓ Resolved SQLAlchemy ORM update pattern issues
   - ✓ Fixed transaction_type constraint issues
   - ✓ Fixed credit_limit_history_repository schema validation
   - ✓ Aligned schema requirements with database constraints
   - ✓ Fixed BalanceReconciliation schema to match database NOT NULL constraints
   - ✓ Fixed BaseRepository transaction handling with nested transaction support
   - Implement comprehensive timezone handling in repository tests
   - Fix date_trunc function missing in SQLite for monthly totals

3. **Service Layer Refactoring (90%)**
   - ✓ AccountService refactored to use repository pattern
   - Refactor remaining services (BillService, PaymentService, etc.)
   - Update API endpoints to use refactored services
   - Ensure proper schema validation in service-to-repository flow

4. **API Enhancement Project - Phase 6 (100%)**
   - Implement recommendations API
   - Develop trend reporting features
   - Create frontend components
   - Build comprehensive API documentation

5. **Mobile Access Features (100%)**
   - Create mobile-responsive UI components
   - Implement offline capabilities
   - Add notification system

## Known Issues

1. **Schema Factory Missing Coverage**
   - Added 6 new factory files but 10 schema types still need factories
   - Newly added factories need tests to ensure proper validation
   - More complex schema types like cashflow models still need factories
   - Categories and payment pattern factories are next priority

2. **Schema Factory Test Migration**
   - All existing tests will need to update import patterns
   - Need to update tests to use direct imports from specific domain modules
   - Factory functions now use decorator pattern consistently

3. **Service Layer Architecture**
   - In progress: Refactoring services to use repository pattern
   - AccountService refactored as proof of concept
   - Remaining services will follow the established pattern
   - Dependency injection framework in place

4. **Repository Error Handling**
   - Need to implement custom repository exceptions
   - Error translation in services needs to be standardized
   - Exception hierarchy should be consistent across the application

5. **SQLAlchemy ORM Update Patterns**
   - Identified and fixed issues with updated_at timestamps not updating properly
   - Need to ensure proper ORM update pattern usage across all repositories
   - Improved documentation needed for SQLAlchemy best practices

6. **Timezone Handling in Repository Tests**
   - Inconsistent datetime comparison between timezone-aware and naive datetimes
   - Need standardized approach for comparing database return values
   - Apply ADR-011 principles consistently across all repositories
   - Repository test cases need updates for proper datetime handling
