# Progress: Debtonator

## Current Priority: Schema Test Implementation

### Recent Improvements
1. **Schema Test Implementation Progress** ✓
   - Implemented Three Important Schema Test Files:
     * test_realtime_cashflow_schemas.py with comprehensive test coverage:
       - Tests for AccountType, AccountBalance, RealtimeCashflow, and RealtimeCashflowResponse
       - Validation of credit-specific fields, uniqueness constraints, and calculation logic
       - Complete UTC timezone validation per ADR-011
     * test_recommendations_schemas.py with thorough validation tests:
       - Tests for RecommendationType, ConfidenceLevel, ImpactMetrics, RecommendationBase, BillPaymentTimingRecommendation, and RecommendationResponse
       - Validation of enum values, decimal precision, and value ranges
       - Complete UTC timezone validation
     * test_income_categories_schemas.py with complete CRUD schema tests:
       - Tests for IncomeCategoryBase, IncomeCategoryCreate, IncomeCategoryUpdate, and IncomeCategory
       - Validation of string length constraints and required fields
   - Each test file implements standard test pattern:
     * Tests for valid object creation with required and optional fields
     * Tests for field validations (required fields, constraints)
     * Tests for decimal precision on monetary fields
     * Tests for UTC datetime validation per ADR-011
     * Tests for business logic validations and cross-field validation
     * Verification of BaseSchemaValidator inheritance
   - Updated schema_test_implementation_checklist.md:
     * Marked 15 of 21 test files as completed
     * Documented standard pattern to follow for remaining files
     * Added detailed notes on timezone validation requirements
     * Marked appropriate tests as N/A where fields don't exist in schema

2. **Version Management Implementation** ✓
   - Created src/version.py to provide consistent version access:
     * Defined VERSION_MAJOR, VERSION_MINOR, and VERSION_PATCH constants
     * Implemented VERSION formatted string
     * Added VERSION_TUPLE for structured access
     * Added comprehensive docstrings explaining purpose
     * Created proper module exports
   - Benefits of this approach:
     * Allows programmatic access to version information from code
     * Enables version display in UI and API responses
     * Facilitates version checks in future CI/CD pipelines
     * Provides single source of truth for version information
     * Maintains synchronization with pyproject.toml version

3. **Pydantic v2 Compatibility Fix** ✓
   - Fixed validation context handling to support Pydantic v2:
     * Updated `validate_parent_id_common` in categories.py to work with ValidationInfo objects
     * Made the function backward compatible with dictionary-style validation context
     * Added proper error handling for different validation context types
     * Fixed related test failures across schema test files
     * Improved robustness against future Pydantic changes
   - Fixed schema test error patterns:
     * Updated test patterns for validation errors to match Pydantic v2 format
     * Fixed test_bulk_operation_validation in test_bill_splits_schemas.py
     * Updated assertion patterns to match new error message formats
     * Made tests more resilient to minor error message changes

4. **Timezone Compliance Issues** ✓
   - Fixed Critical Timezone Compliance Issues:
     * Replaced all instances of `ZoneInfo("UTC")` with `timezone.utc` in 4 schema test files:
       - test_categories_schemas.py
       - test_credit_limits_schemas.py
       - test_bill_splits_schemas.py
       - test_balance_reconciliation_schemas.py
     * Ensured all datetime creations follow ADR-011 standards
     * Made tests consistent with the timezone approach used in the codebase
     * Removed unnecessary ZoneInfo imports where possible (keeping for non-UTC test cases)
     * Updated import statements to include timezone from datetime
   - Discovered and Fixed Non-UTC Timezone Creation Issue:
     * Identified incorrect pattern: `timezone(hours=5)` causing TypeError
     * Implemented correct pattern: `timezone(timedelta(hours=5))`
     * Added timedelta import to affected files
     * Updated timezone validation assertion pattern to avoid Pylint errors
     * Documented the correct pattern in schema_test_implementation_checklist.md
