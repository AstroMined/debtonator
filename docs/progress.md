# Progress: Debtonator

## Current Status Overview

1. **Model Layer**: COMPLETED (100%) ✓
   - All 18 models fully compliant with ADR-011 and ADR-012
   - Comprehensive test coverage in place

2. **Schema Layer**: COMPLETED (100%) ✓
   - All 21 schema files fully compliant with ADR-011 and ADR-012
   - Pydantic V2 compatibility with Annotated types approach

3. **Service Layer**: IN PROGRESS (87%)
   - Repository pattern foundation complete (ADR-014)
   - 13 of 13 core repositories implemented (100%)
   - Integration tests for repositories (100%)
   - Repository test standardization (100%)
   - Service refactoring to use repositories (0%)

4. **Documentation**: COMPLETED (100%) ✓
   - All ADRs up-to-date
   - Implementation guidelines documented
   - Model and schema compliance documentation completed

5. **Decimal Precision Handling**: COMPLETED (100%) ✓
   - Two-tier precision model implemented (2 decimal UI, 4 decimal DB)
   - API response formatting with proper precision
   - Comprehensive testing across all components

## What Works

1. **Account & Transaction Management**
   - Dynamic account management with multiple account types
   - Balance and credit limit tracking
   - Transaction history with proper decimal precision
   - Statement balance history tracking

2. **Bill Management**
   - Bill tracking with due dates and payment status
   - Split payment support across multiple accounts
   - Payment tracking with source allocation
   - Auto-pay status management

3. **Financial Analysis**
   - Cross-account balance tracking
   - Financial forecasting with minimum calculations
   - Income requirement projections
   - Tax consideration in calculations

4. **Schema Validation**
   - Consistent field validation across all schemas
   - Proper UTC timezone handling for all datetime fields
   - Decimal precision validation for monetary values
   - Cross-field validation for data consistency

5. **Core Architecture**
   - Repository pattern for data access
   - Service layer with business logic isolation
   - API response formatting with proper precision
   - Version management for semantic versioning

## What's Left to Build

1. **Repository Test Standardization (75%)**
   - ✓ Standardized schema file naming to match model naming
   - ✓ Fixed inconsistent schema requirements in tests
   - ✓ Eliminated circular imports in schema layer
   - ✓ All unit tests passing (441 tests)
   - Integration tests for repositories still need fixing

2. **Repository Layer Completion (15%)**
   - Implement remaining repositories
   - Add transaction boundary support
   - Implement bulk_update method

3. **Service Layer Refactoring (100%)**
   - Refactor services to use repository pattern
   - Update API endpoints to use refactored services
   - Create unit tests with mock repositories
   - Ensure proper schema validation in service-to-repository flow

4. **API Enhancement Project - Phase 6 (100%)**
   - Implement recommendations API
   - Develop trend reporting features
   - Create frontend components
   - Build comprehensive API documentation

5. **Mobile Access Features (100%)**
   - Create mobile-responsive UI components
   - Implement offline capabilities
   - Add notification system

## Known Issues

1. **Dictionary Validation Complexity**
   - Dictionary fields with decimal values need special validation handling
   - Nested dictionaries require custom validation strategies
   - Current implementation addresses these challenges, but requires careful testing

2. **Service Layer Architecture**
   - Current service files mix data access and business logic
   - Repository pattern implementation will address this issue
   - Refactoring required to fully separate concerns

3. **Repository Test Validation Gap**
   - Some repository tests are currently bypassing schema validation
   - Tests don't properly simulate the service-to-repository flow
   - Implementation of standardized test pattern is now in progress
   - First reference implementation complete, remaining tests need updating
