### Previous Improvements
1. **Reverted ConstrainedDecimal Implementation Due to Pydantic V2 Incompatibility** ✓
   - Identified critical compatibility issue with our decimal precision implementation:
     * The `ConstrainedDecimal` class used in our implementation has been removed in Pydantic V2
     * This caused import errors that broke the application completely
     * Needed immediate action to restore application functionality
   - Implemented a clean solution to restore functionality:
     * Used `git reset --hard f31eb74` to revert to previous working commit
     * Verified application functionality was restored
     * Created a new implementation plan compatible with Pydantic V2
   - Analyzed root cause and documented the incompatibility:
     * `ConstrainedDecimal` and other "constrained" classes were removed entirely
     * Pydantic V2 recommends using Annotated types with Field constraints instead
     * This required a complete redesign of our validation approach
   - Created a comprehensive implementation plan for moving forward:
     * Created `docs/adr/compliance/adr013_implementation_checklist_v2.md` with the new approach

     * Simple type aliases like `MoneyDict = Dict[str, MoneyDecimal]` might not validate properly
     * Nested dictionaries presented additional validation challenges
   - Developed a robust dictionary validation strategy:
     * Implemented a `validate_decimal_dictionaries` model validator
     * Created specialized validation for MoneyDict and PercentageDict types
     * Added proper error messages for validation failures
     * Ensured dictionary validation works across nested structures

     * The method expected field description as a single positional parameter followed by kwargs
     * All calls now properly use `default=...` for default values
     * Standardized approach across all schema files
   - Fixed test file corruption:
     * Repaired `tests/unit/schemas/test_accounts_schemas.py` which had duplicated content
     * Fixed a syntax error with imports appearing after function definition
     * Restored proper structure with imports at the beginning of file
   - These fixes ensure consistent parameter passing across all schema files:
     * All money_field() calls now use proper keyword arguments
     * Percentage_field() calls use the same pattern for consistency
     * Test files correctly validate the behavior of these fields

## Known Issues
1. **ConstrainedDecimal Incompatibility with Pydantic V2**
   - The `ConstrainedDecimal` class used in our implementation has been removed in Pydantic V2
   - We've successfully reverted to a working commit and created a new implementation plan
   - The revised plan uses Annotated types with Field constraints instead
   - This approach is fully compatible with Pydantic V2 and more maintainable

2. **Dictionary Validation Complexity**
   - Dictionary fields with decimal values need special handling
   - Simple type aliases don't enforce validation for dictionary values
   - Nested structures need custom validation logic
   - We've developed a comprehensive strategy to address these challenges
   - The reference implementation demonstrates proper validation techniques
