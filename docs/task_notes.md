# End session

- **SWITCH TO PLAN MODE IF YOU'RE NOT ALREADY THERE!!!**
- If you have not done so yet:
  - update memory bank
    - Ensure you define a good starting point for our next working session
  - update README.md, CHANGELOG.md and pyproject.toml
    - update minor or patch semantic versioning as needed
      - DO NOT UPDATE MAJOR VERSION, as we haven't had a full, stable release yet.
    - PLEASE TAKE GREAT CARE TO ENSURE YOUR CHANGES TO README.md AND CHANGELOG.md CONTAIN THE FULL OUTPUT; DO NOT USE PLACEHOLDERS.
  - Create ADRs ONLY if absolutely necessary to document a MAJOR architectural change.
- Finally, suggest a good commit message for the tasks accomplished during this session.
