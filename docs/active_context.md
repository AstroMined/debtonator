## Implementation Lessons

1. **Repository Selection Strategy**
   - Use existing repositories for data access operations rather than creating new ones
   - Maintain single responsibility principle by using the repository that owns the entity
   - Use polymorphic repositories with proper type handling for account-related operations
   - Ensure repositories focus on data access and services focus on business logic

2. **Repository Method Documentation**
   - Document clear parameter requirements including timezone expectations
   - Add "Returns" section in docstrings with explanations of return types and formats
   - Clarify whether methods expect timezone-aware or naive datetimes
   - Include usage notes for proper integration with other services
   - Add examples of method usage for complex parameter combinations
   - Document error conditions and what exceptions might be raised

3. **Service-Repository Integration Pattern**
   - Always use BaseService._get_repository() method for repository access
   - Never use direct repository initialization in services
   - Follow established pattern for constructor initialization
   - Pass feature flag service and config provider to super().__init__()
   - Always maintain the pattern of delegating data operations to repositories
   - Keep business logic in the service layer while data access goes in repositories
   - Use specialized repository methods rather than reimplementing data access logic

4. **Service Dependency Refinement**
   - Use specialized service implementations (e.g., MetricsService) instead of high-level facades
   - Maintain clear separation of concerns in service dependencies
   - Document dependencies and initialization order in service constructors
   - Allow dependency injection while providing default instantiation for convenience
   - Ensure proper parameter passing to dependent service constructors

5. **ADR-011 Datetime Compliance**
   - Always use utility functions for datetime operations:
     - utc_now() for the current time with proper timezone
     - ensure_utc() for guaranteeing timezone awareness
     - naive_start_of_day() and naive_end_of_day() for DB operations
   - Maintain consistent pattern of storing naive datetimes in the database
   - Use timezone-aware datetimes in the service and API boundaries
   - Be explicit about timezone handling in method signatures and docstrings
   - Use proper timezone-aware datetime comparisons
   - Convert dates to datetime objects with consistent timezone handling
