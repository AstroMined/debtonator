# Active Context: Debtonator

## Current Focus
Datetime Standardization Project

### Recent Changes
1. **Datetime Standardization (High Priority)**
   - ADR-011 updated with strict requirements:
     * Mandated UTC timezone-aware datetime throughout
     * Prohibited date objects and naive datetimes
     * Defined correct and incorrect patterns
   - Previous Progress:
     * ✓ Some schemas updated with timezone-aware datetime
     * ✓ Some test files fixed for timezone awareness
   - Next Steps (Blocking All Other Work):
     * Update BaseModel datetime handling
     * Convert all date fields to UTC datetime
     * Remove all timezone conversion utilities
     * Fix all datetime creation points
     * Update all test fixtures

2. **Payment Pattern Test Improvements (Completed)**
   - ✓ Fixed test assertions:
     * Updated seasonal pattern test to expect 6 payments
     * Corrected test documentation to reflect actual fixture behavior
     * Verified all payment pattern tests passing
   - ✓ Maintained test accuracy:
     * Ensured test expectations match implementation
     * Validated seasonal pattern detection
     * Confirmed proper fixture behavior

2. **Split Analysis System Implementation**
   - ✓ Created split analysis schemas
   - ✓ Implemented optimization metrics calculation
   - ✓ Added impact analysis system
   - ✓ Added optimization suggestions
   - ✓ Added comprehensive test coverage
   - ✓ Fixed decimal precision handling

2. **Payment Pattern Analysis Improvements (Completed)**
   - ✓ Fixed pattern detection issues:
     * Fixed days before due date calculation
     * Improved pattern confidence scoring
     * Enhanced standard deviation calculations
     * Added proper target days handling
     * Fixed test fixtures for consistent patterns
     * Improved test coverage for pattern detection
   - ✓ Enhanced test coverage:
     * Added borderline pattern tests
     * Added amount statistics edge cases
     * Added single-day difference tests
     * Fixed edge case handling
   - ✓ Fixed all test failures
   - ✓ Completed refactoring to bill-specific patterns:
     * Renamed to BillPaymentPatternService
     * Updated tests for bill-payment relationships
     * Removed non-bill pattern tests
     * Added TODO for future ExpensePatternService
     * Added warning notes for payments close to due dates

3. **Previous Work: Account-specific Forecasts Implementation**
   - ✓ Created account-specific forecast schemas
   - ✓ Implemented account-specific forecast service
   - ✓ Added recurring bill handling
   - ✓ Added credit utilization tracking
   - ✓ Implemented warning flags system
   - ✓ Added confidence scoring
   - ✓ Added comprehensive test coverage
   - ✓ Fixed all test failures

### Recent Decisions
1. **Implementation Strategy**
   - Strict enforcement of UTC timezone-aware datetime
   - No date/datetime flexibility allowed
   - Create datetime objects correctly from the start
   - No conversion utilities or helpers
   - Only bulk import and API may handle timezone conversion
   - All existing work paused until datetime standardization complete
   - Comprehensive testing for UTC compliance

2. **Enhancement Priorities**
   - [x] Account management complete
   - [x] Bill categorization complete
   - [x] Auto-pay complete
   - [x] Bulk import complete
   - [x] Payment scheduling complete
   - [x] Split validation complete
   - [x] Historical analysis complete
   - [x] Impact analysis complete
   - [x] Income trends analysis complete
   - [x] Cross-account analysis complete
   - [x] Payment patterns complete
   - [x] Split analysis complete

## Active Decisions

### Phase 1: Core Datetime Updates (Current)
- [ ] BaseModel Changes
  - [ ] Update created_at/updated_at defaults
  - [ ] Remove any date field usage
  - [ ] Add datetime validation
- [ ] Model Updates
  - [ ] Payment dates to UTC datetime
  - [ ] Bill due dates to UTC datetime
  - [ ] Income dates to UTC datetime
  - [ ] Transaction dates to UTC datetime

### Phase 2: Service Updates (Next)
- [ ] Cashflow Service
  - [ ] Update all datetime creation
  - [ ] Fix date arithmetic
  - [ ] Update tests
- [ ] Payment Services
  - [ ] Update pattern detection
  - [ ] Fix scheduling logic
  - [ ] Update tests
- [ ] Analysis Services
  - [ ] Update historical analysis
  - [ ] Fix period calculations
  - [ ] Update tests

### Paused Work (Pending Datetime Standardization)
- API Enhancement Project - Phase 6
  - Recommendations (paused)
  - Trend reporting (paused)

## Next Steps

### Phase 3: Schema Updates (After Services)
- [ ] Update all Pydantic schemas
- [ ] Remove any date type usage
- [ ] Update validation rules
- [ ] Update API documentation

### Phase 4: Test Coverage (Final)
- [ ] Update all test fixtures
- [ ] Add datetime validation tests
- [ ] Verify UTC consistency
- [ ] Add timezone edge case tests

### Future Work (After Datetime Standardization)
1. Resume API Enhancement Project
   - Complete recommendation engine
   - Implement trend reporting
   - Add remaining analysis features
