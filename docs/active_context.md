## Implementation Lessons

1. **Service-Repository Integration Pattern**
   - Always use BaseService._get_repository() method for repository access
   - Never use direct repository initialization in services
   - Follow established pattern for constructor initialization
   - Pass feature flag service and config provider to super().__init__()
   - Always maintain the pattern of delegating data operations to repositories
   - Keep business logic in the service layer while data operations go in repositories
   - Use specialized repository methods rather than reimplementing data access logic

2. **Error Handling With Context**
   - Add entity-specific context to error classes (e.g., account_id, category_id, name)
   - Implement specialized error classes for domain-specific errors
   - Preserve error propagation through layers with informative messages
   - Include enough contextual information for effective debugging
   - Use descriptive error messages that explain the failure and potential solutions
   - Standardize error class naming with domain prefixes and "Error" suffix

3. **ADR-011 Datetime Compliance**
   - Always use utility functions for datetime operations:
     - utc_now() for the current time with proper timezone
     - ensure_utc() for guaranteeing timezone awareness
     - naive_start_of_day() and naive_end_of_day() for DB operations
   - Maintain consistent pattern of storing naive datetimes in the database
   - Use timezone-aware datetimes in the service and API boundaries
   - Be explicit about timezone handling in method signatures and docstrings
   - Use proper timezone-aware datetime comparisons

4. **Repository Method Documentation**
   - Document clear parameter requirements including timezone expectations
   - Add "Returns" section in docstrings with explanations of return types and formats
   - Clarify whether methods expect timezone-aware or naive datetimes
   - Include usage notes for proper integration with other services
   - Add examples of method usage for complex parameter combinations
   - Document error conditions and what exceptions might be raised

5. **Handling Relationships in Repository Layer**
   - Use get_with_relationships method for loading multiple relationships
   - Create specialized methods for specific relationship patterns
   - Avoid redundant data loading by using targeted relationship loading
   - Maintain consistency with SQLAlchemy relationship definitions
   - Properly handle circular references in data composition methods
   - Document relationship loading behavior in method docstrings
