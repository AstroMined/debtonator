### Implementation Lessons
1. **Centralized Schema Validation Architecture**
   - The centralized approach with enhanced `BaseSchemaValidator` provides many benefits:
     * Reduced code duplication across schema files
     * Consistent field definitions and validation behavior
     * Simpler schema file maintenance and updates
     * Clear separation of concerns between precision handling and schemas
   - Field creation utility methods provide key advantages:
     * Standardized field definitions enforce consistent validation
     * Self-documenting code with clear precision intent
     * Easier to maintain and update validation rules
     * Special cases handled through metadata rather than custom validators
   - Keeping precision validation in two locations maintains clarity:
     * Core module for calculation and distribution utilities
     * Base validator for API boundary validation
     * Prevents fragmentation across multiple utility files
     * Clear responsibilities with minimal overlap

2. **Financial Calculation Handling**
   - Using 4 decimal places for internal calculations provides sufficient precision
   - The Decimal class properly handles precision-critical operations
   - Explicitly converting to Decimal early in calculation chains prevents precision loss
   - Rounding should be applied consistently at specific points, not throughout calculations
   - Percentage calculations particularly benefit from higher precision
   - Risk scoring calculations need careful handling for decimal-to-integer conversions

2. **Core Module Structure**
   - The src/core directory approach works well for cross-cutting business concerns
   - Static methods on utility classes provide a clean interface for common operations
   - Explicit function naming improves clarity of precision intent
   - Core modules should be focused on single responsibility
   - Documentation within core modules should explain when and how to use functions
   - Better to provide targeted utility functions than comprehensive classes
