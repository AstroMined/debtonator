# Active Context: Debtonator

## Current Focus
API Cleanup & Test Coverage

### Recent Implementation
1. **Bills to Liabilities Migration**
   - ✓ Removed deprecated bills schema
   - ✓ Removed unused bills service
   - ✓ Removed deprecated bills endpoints
   - ✓ Updated router configuration
   - ✓ Verified no frontend dependencies

2. **Test Coverage Status**
   - Overall coverage: 57%
   - Models maintain high coverage (94-100%)
   - Schemas have excellent coverage (88-100%)
   - API endpoints need coverage (28-44%)
   - Services need coverage (20-40%)

3. **System State**
   - Clean architecture with no deprecated endpoints
   - All bill functionality handled by liabilities
   - No remaining technical debt from migration
   - Core functionality validated

### Recent Changes
1. **API Cleanup**
   - ✓ Removed bills.py schema
   - ✓ Removed bills.py service
   - ✓ Removed bills API endpoints
   - ✓ Updated router configuration
   - ✓ Verified no regressions

2. **Test Suite Status**
   - ✓ All 32 tests passing
   - ✓ No regressions from cleanup
   - ✓ Coverage slightly improved
   - [ ] API endpoints need tests
   - [ ] Services need tests

## Active Decisions

### Phase 1: API Testing (Next)
- [ ] Design API test strategy
- [ ] Create test data fixtures
- [ ] Implement endpoint tests
- [ ] Test error scenarios
- [ ] Verify data persistence

### Phase 2: Service Testing
- [ ] Plan service test coverage
- [ ] Create service test helpers
- [ ] Test core service functions
- [ ] Test edge cases
- [ ] Verify error handling

### Phase 3: Integration Testing
- [ ] Design integration test suite
- [ ] Create test scenarios
- [ ] Test cross-service flows
- [ ] Verify end-to-end paths

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. API Test Coverage
   - Focus on liabilities endpoints
   - Test CRUD operations
   - Verify error handling
   - Test data validation

2. Service Layer Testing
   - Start with liabilities service
   - Test core operations
   - Verify business logic
   - Test relationships

3. Documentation
   - Update API documentation
   - Document test patterns
   - Create test guidelines
   - Update coverage reports

### Future Work
1. Frontend Testing (2-3 days)
   - Component tests
   - State management tests
   - Form validation tests
   - Integration tests

2. Performance Testing (1-2 days)
   - Load testing
   - Response times
   - Database queries
   - API endpoints
