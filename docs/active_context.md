     * Provides clear architectural separation from utilities
     * Creates foundation for other core business modules

2. **Schema Test Timezone and Error Message Fixes** ✓
   - Fixed timestamp handling in all failing test files to fully comply with ADR-011:
     * Fixed timezone creation in balance_history_schemas.py using `timezone(timedelta(hours=5))` pattern
     * Updated error message patterns in accounts_schemas.py to match exact Pydantic errors

     * Updated regex patterns to match actual Pydantic error messages
     * Dynamic date generation to prevent test failures with hardcoded dates
     * Tests properly validate current schema validation behaviors

### Implementation Lessons
1. **Standardized Field Methods Improve Consistency**
   - The use of standardized field creation methods provides key benefits:
     * Makes decimal precision requirements explicit in code
     * Reduces duplication of validation logic
     * Creates a single source of truth for validation rules
     * Enables easy updates to validation behavior
   - Field methods are more maintainable than custom validators:
     * Self-documenting with clear intention 
     * Reduces chance of inconsistent validation
     * Easier to scan and understand code
     * Allows proper handling of special cases
   - This approach bridges schema and domain models elegantly:
     * Schemas remain focused on validation
     * Core module contains business logic
     * Base validator bridges the two concerns
     * Clear separation of responsibilities

2. **Centralized Schema Validation Architecture**
   - The centralized approach with enhanced `BaseSchemaValidator` provides many benefits:
     * Reduced code duplication across schema files
     * Consistent field definitions and validation behavior
     * Simpler schema file maintenance and updates
     * Clear separation of concerns between precision handling and schemas
   - Field creation utility methods provide key advantages:
     * Standardized field definitions enforce consistent validation
     * Self-documenting code with clear precision intent
     * Easier to maintain and update validation rules
     * Special cases handled through metadata rather than custom validators
   - Keeping precision validation in two locations maintains clarity:
     * Core module for calculation and distribution utilities
     * Base validator for API boundary validation
     * Prevents fragmentation across multiple utility files
     * Clear responsibilities with minimal overlap

3. **Financial Calculation Handling**
   - Using 4 decimal places for internal calculations provides sufficient precision
   - The Decimal class properly handles precision-critical operations
   - Explicitly converting to Decimal early in calculation chains prevents precision loss
   - Rounding should be applied consistently at specific points, not throughout calculations
   - Percentage calculations particularly benefit from higher precision
   - Risk scoring calculations need careful handling for decimal-to-integer conversions
