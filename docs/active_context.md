   - ✓ Completed liabilities service test coverage (100%)
   - ✓ Improved bulk import service coverage (91%)
   - ✓ Fixed method name mismatch in bulk import service
   - ✓ Added comprehensive test suites for all services

2. **Test Coverage Status**
   - Overall service coverage: 94% (↑31%)
   - High coverage services:
     * Bill Splits: 100%
     * Bulk Import: 91%
     * Cashflow: 100%
     * Liabilities: 100%
     * Payments: 100%
   - Services needing improvement:
     * Income: 86%

3. **System State**
   - All 72 tests passing
   - No regressions from new tests
   - Established test patterns
   - Clean test fixtures
   - Verified relationship loading

### Recent Changes
1. **Test Infrastructure**
   - ✓ Added bill splits test fixtures
   - ✓ Added bulk import test data files
   - ✓ Enhanced error handling in bulk import
   - ✓ Improved decimal precision handling
   - ✓ Fixed file handling in bulk import tests

2. **Test Suite Status**
   - ✓ All tests passing
   - ✓ No regressions
   - ✓ Coverage improved significantly
   - [ ] API endpoints need tests
   - [ ] Integration tests needed

## Active Decisions

### Phase 1: Service Testing
- [x] Plan service test coverage
- [x] Create service test helpers
- [x] Test relationship loading
- [x] Test edge cases
- [x] Verify error handling

### Phase 2: API Testing (Next Focus)
- [ ] Design test strategy
- [ ] Create test fixtures
- [ ] Test endpoint validation
- [ ] Test error handling
- [ ] Verify response formats

### Phase 3: Integration Testing
- [ ] Design integration test suite
- [ ] Create test scenarios
- [ ] Test cross-service flows
- [ ] Verify end-to-end paths

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. API Test Coverage
   - Start with bill splits endpoints
   - Test core operations
   - Verify business logic
   - Test relationships

2. Integration Testing
   - Design test scenarios
   - Test service interactions
   - Verify data flow
   - Test error propagation

3. Documentation
   - Update API documentation
   - Document test patterns
   - Create test guidelines
   - Update coverage reports

### Future Work
1. Frontend Testing (2-3 days)
   - Component tests
   - State management tests
   - Form validation tests
   - Integration tests

2. Performance Testing (1-2 days)
   - Load testing
   - Response times
   - Database queries
   - API endpoints
