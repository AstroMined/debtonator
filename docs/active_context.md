     * Fixed edge case handling
   - ✓ Fixed all test failures
   - ✓ Completed refactoring to bill-specific patterns:
     * Renamed to BillPaymentPatternService
     * Updated tests for bill-payment relationships
     * Removed non-bill pattern tests
     * Added TODO for future ExpensePatternService
     * Added warning notes for payments close to due dates

3. **Previous Work: Account-specific Forecasts Implementation**
   - ✓ Created account-specific forecast schemas
   - ✓ Implemented account-specific forecast service
   - ✓ Added recurring bill handling
   - ✓ Added credit utilization tracking
   - ✓ Implemented warning flags system
   - ✓ Added confidence scoring
   - ✓ Added comprehensive test coverage
   - ✓ Fixed all test failures

### Recent Decisions
1. **Implementation Strategy**
   - Strict enforcement of UTC timezone-aware datetime
   - No date/datetime flexibility allowed
   - Create datetime objects correctly from the start
   - No conversion utilities or helpers
   - Only bulk import and API may handle timezone conversion
   - All existing work paused until datetime standardization complete
   - Comprehensive testing for UTC compliance

2. **Enhancement Priorities**
   - [x] Account management complete
   - [x] Bill categorization complete
   - [x] Auto-pay complete
   - [x] Bulk import complete
   - [x] Payment scheduling complete
   - [x] Split validation complete
   - [x] Historical analysis complete
   - [x] Impact analysis complete
   - [x] Income trends analysis complete
   - [x] Cross-account analysis complete
   - [x] Payment patterns complete
   - [x] Split analysis complete

## Active Decisions
