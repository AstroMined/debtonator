   - Enhanced field handling logic in polymorphic repositories:
     - Improved distinction between required and optional fields
     - Added proper handling for fields not explicitly included in update data
     - Maintained type safety with proper field validation
     - Ensured backward compatibility with existing code
   - This fix ensures:
     - Partial updates only modify fields explicitly included in the update data
     - Optional fields with existing values are preserved when not explicitly set to NULL
     - Required fields continue to be protected from NULL values
     - The repository behaves as expected for both complete and partial updates
     - Tests properly verify field preservation behavior

## Next Steps

## Implementation Lessons

1. **Schema-Model Field Alignment**
   - Keep model fields and schema fields aligned to prevent runtime errors
   - Validate that model fields can accept values from schema fields
   - Consider creating utility tools to verify schema-model compatibility
   - Move type-specific fields to the appropriate subclass schemas
   - Be careful about backward compatibility fields that could cause issues
   - Consider using field validation at the schema level for type-specific fields
   - Use proper inheritance patterns in both models and schemas
   - Ensure proper separation of concerns in the class hierarchy

2. **Polymorphic Repository Pattern**
   - Use specialized base repository for polymorphic entities (`PolymorphicBaseRepository`)
   - Disable base `create` and `update` methods with `NotImplementedError` to prevent incorrect usage
   - Implement type-specific creation and update methods (`create_typed_entity`, `update_typed_entity`)
   - Always use concrete subclasses that match the intended polymorphic type
   - Integrate with type registries for proper model class lookup
   - Implement automatic field validation and filtering based on model class
   - Ensure proper type handling and identity management
   - Prevent setting invalid fields that don't exist on specific model classes
   - Use consistent interface for all polymorphic repositories
   - Design for future expansion to support any number of polymorphic entity types
   - Preserve optional fields with existing values during partial updates
   - Skip setting optional fields to NULL if they already have a value

3. **Repository Fixture Usage Patterns**
   - Use repository_factory as a function, not as an object with methods
   - Understand the difference between class-based and function-based fixtures
   - Ensure consistent fixture usage patterns across similar repository types
   - Verify fixture implementation matches usage in tests
   - Document fixture usage patterns for team reference

4. **Repository Test Organization**
   - Separate CRUD tests from advanced repository tests
   - Place basic CRUD operations (create, get, update, delete) in crud/ directory
   - Place specialized operations in advanced/ directory
   - Maintain consistent test naming across similar repository types
   - Follow established patterns from working test files

5. **Feature Flag System Architecture**
   - Centralize feature flag enforcement at architectural boundaries instead of scattering checks
   - Use proxy/interceptor patterns to separate business logic from feature gating
   - Implement domain-specific exceptions for better error handling and clarity
   - Store both flag values AND requirements in the database for runtime configuration
   - Use caching with appropriate TTL for performance optimization
   - Implement account type extraction to support feature flags for specific account types
   - Follow bottom-up implementation approach starting at repository layer
   - Ensure consistent async/await patterns throughout the system
   - Use cache-aware testing strategies to handle TTL caching effects
   - Provide zero-TTL options for testing environments to avoid race conditions
   - Add helper utilities for clear cache invalidation when needed
   - Implement proper inspection of async methods to avoid mismatches

6. **Test Consolidation for Complete Coverage**
   - Analyze coverage reports to identify specific uncovered lines and branches
   - Combine complementary test files that cover different parts of the same functionality
   - Create targeted tests for specific edge cases that are missed by existing tests
   - Use descriptive test names that clearly indicate what scenario is being tested
   - Maintain all existing test functionality when consolidating test files
   - Focus on branch coverage for conditional logic, especially in financial calculations
   - Test both positive and negative scenarios for complete coverage
   - Verify coverage with specific coverage reports after changes

7. **Schema Validation Patterns**
   - Separate field validation from model validation for better control flow
   - Use field validators for format and basic constraints
   - Use model validators for cross-field validation and business rules
   - Implement proper validation flow with field validators running first
   - Handle implicit field values in model validators
   - Add clear error messages for validation failures
   - Document validation behavior in docstrings
   - Test both field and model validation scenarios
