# Active Context: Debtonator

## Current Focus
Strengthening Repository Layer Validation and Testing (ADR-014)

### Recent Changes

1. **Enhanced Repository Layer Validation Strategy in ADR-014** ✓
   - Updated ADR-014 to clarify validation responsibilities across architectural layers
   - Explicitly defined the validation boundary between service and repository layers
   - Added detailed examples of proper service-to-repository validation flow
   - Emphasized that repositories must never be called with raw, unvalidated data
   - Created clear coding examples showing validation in both services and tests

2. **Created Repository Test Template Pattern** ✓
   - Developed standardized 4-step pattern for repository tests (Arrange-Schema-Act-Assert)
   - Created comprehensive repository_test_pattern.md guide in docs/guides
   - Documented common pitfalls and best practices for repository testing
   - Provided clear examples for all test scenarios (creation, updates, validation errors)
   - Created consistent pattern for test organization and structure

3. **Implemented Schema Factory Functions** ✓
   - Created tests/helpers/schema_factories.py with factory functions for test data
   - Implemented functions for BillSplit, Liability, Account, and Payment schemas
   - Added flexible override capabilities to all factory functions
   - Standardized default values and patterns across all schemas
   - Documented usage patterns for maintainability

4. **Created Reference Implementation for Repository Tests** ✓
   - Refactored test_bill_split_repository.py to follow proper validation flow
   - Implemented full Pydantic validation in existing tests (create, update, bulk_create)
   - Added explicit validation error test demonstrating schema validation importance
   - Updated all assertions to verify both repository operation and schema validation
   - Created pattern for other repository tests to follow

5. **Enhanced Validation Test Coverage** ✓
   - Added test_validation_error_handling to demonstrate proper error handling
   - Improved test documentation with clear explanations of validation pattern importance
   - Updated test fixtures to work with schema validation approach
   - Added proper model_dump() handling to convert validated schema to dict
   - Ensured comprehensive validation testing for Bill Split repository

## Next Steps

1. **Refactor Remaining Repository Tests**
   - Update integration tests for all repositories to follow the validation pattern
   - Update test fixtures to use schema factory functions
   - Add validation error tests for each repository
   - Update all repository tests to follow the 4-step pattern
   - Ensure complete test coverage of validation flow

2. **Complete Repository Layer Implementation**
   - Implement the remaining repositories (CreditLimitHistory, BalanceReconciliation, TransactionHistory)
   - Implement advanced repository features (bulk_update, transaction boundaries)
   - Ensure all new repository implementations follow validation pattern
   - Complete integration test coverage for all repositories

3. **Start Service Layer Refactoring**
   - Refactor AccountService as proof of concept
   - Create unit tests using mock repositories
   - Ensure proper schema validation in service-to-repository flow
   - Update API endpoints to use refactored services

## Implementation Lessons

1. **Repository Testing Best Practices**
   - Repository tests must reflect actual application flow by validating through schemas first
   - Use factory functions to reduce test code duplication and maintain consistency
   - Follow the standard 4-step pattern: Arrange, Schema, Act, Assert
   - Add explicit validation error tests to verify schema validation behavior
   - Include both happy path and error case tests for comprehensive coverage

2. **Validation Responsibility Boundaries**
   - Services are responsible for all data validation before passing to repositories
   - Repositories should assume data has been validated and focus purely on data access
   - Tests must simulate this flow by using schemas for validation
   - Never pass raw, unvalidated data to repositories, even in tests
   - When in doubt, validate through schemas to ensure consistency
