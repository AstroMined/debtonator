# Active Context: Debtonator

## Current Focus
Implementing and Validating Repository Layer Integration Tests (ADR-014)

### Recent Changes

1. **Implemented Repository Integration Tests** ✓
   - Created comprehensive test file for PaymentScheduleRepository
   - Implemented tests for RecurringIncomeRepository following Arrange-Schema-Act-Assert pattern
   - Developed IncomeCategoryRepository tests with proper schema validation flow
   - Created CashflowForecastRepository tests with complete method coverage
   - Enhanced CreditLimitHistoryRepository tests with missing method tests
   - Standardized test structure with four-step pattern across all implementations
   - Ensured consistent use of schema factories for validation
   - Added proper transaction boundary and error handling tests
   - Implemented relationship loading validation in all repository tests
   - Used timezone-aware handling for all datetime comparisons

2. **Updated Implementation Checklist** ✓
   - Marked all repository implementation tasks as complete (18/18)
   - Updated test implementation status to reflect completed tests
   - Documented schema factory implementation completeness
   - Adjusted recommendations to focus on service layer integration
   - Revised implementation priorities for next phase of work
   - Provided clear status indicators for all completed work
   - Acknowledged successful pattern standardization across repositories
   - Maintained comprehensive tracking of implementation progress
   - Documented completion of high-priority repository tasks
   - Set appropriate focus for remaining service layer work


## Next Steps

1. **Service Layer Integration**
   - Refactor remaining services to use repositories
   - Create services for new repository models (PaymentSchedule, DepositSchedule, etc.)
   - Implement proper validation flow in services
   - Update API endpoints to use refactored services
   - Ensure transaction boundaries are respected

2. **Test Additional Repositories**
   - Create/Update tests for remaining repositories
   - Apply Arrange-Schema-Act-Assert pattern to all tests
   - Focus on high-traffic repositories first
   - Ensure consistent error handling patterns
   - Verify relationship loading behavior

3. **Documentation Updates**
   - Update API documentation for repository-based endpoints
   - Create service-to-repository integration examples
   - Document common repository usage patterns
   - Update OpenAPI documentation
   - Create examples of service-repository integration

## Implementation Lessons

1. **Repository Implementation Patterns**
   - Follow consistent method naming conventions across repositories
   - Group related functionality (e.g., getters with relationship loading)
   - Use type annotations consistently for better code readability
   - Implement proper error handling for edge cases
   - Include comprehensive docstrings for all methods
   - Follow SQLAlchemy best practices for relationship loading

2. **Repository Method Design**
   - Keep primary query methods simple and focused
   - Use optional parameters to enhance flexibility
   - Support filtering by key attributes (date, account, status)
   - Include relationship loading options where appropriate
   - Return consistent types for similar methods across repositories
   - Provide total calculation methods for financial summaries

3. **SQLAlchemy Query Optimization**
   - Use selectinload for one-to-many relationships
   - Use joinedload for many-to-one relationships
   - Build queries incrementally for better readability
   - Add appropriate ordering for predictable results
   - Use aliased classes for complex joins when needed
   - Optimize relationship loading to prevent N+1 query issues

4. **Repository Testing Considerations**
   - Create specific test cases for each method
   - Test both positive and negative scenarios
   - Validate relationship loading behavior
   - Ensure proper transaction handling
   - Test data retrieval and manipulation methods separately
   - Use schema factories to create valid test data
