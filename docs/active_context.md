## Current Focus
Implementing Service Layer Refactoring (ADR-014)

### Recent Changes

1. **Completed AccountService Refactoring** ✓
   - Refactored AccountService to use repositories instead of direct database access
   - Updated service to inject repositories through constructor
   - Maintained existing functionality while improving architecture
   - Implemented proper schema validation flow throughout the service

2. **Added Required Repository Methods** ✓
   - Added `get_by_account_ordered` to StatementHistoryRepository
   - Added `get_by_account_ordered` to CreditLimitHistoryRepository
   - Added `get_debit_sum_for_account` and `get_credit_sum_for_account` to TransactionHistoryRepository
   - Ensured backward compatibility with existing code

3. **Implemented Unit Tests for BaseRepository** ✓
   - Created dedicated unit tests for BaseRepository
   - Tested all CRUD operations with real database fixtures
   - Implemented tests for filtering, pagination, and relationship loading
   - Added tests for transaction boundaries and error handling

4. **Updated Service Tests** ✓
   - Updated AccountService tests to work with repository pattern
   - Used real database fixtures instead of mocks
   - Added tests for new functionality like retrieving history
   - Followed the Arrange-Schema-Act-Assert pattern consistently

5. **Created Service-Repository Integration Documentation** ✓
   - Documented patterns for integrating services with repositories
   - Included examples of dependency injection and transaction management
   - Defined clear validation flow and error handling patterns
   - Established testing approach with real fixtures

## Next Steps

1. **Refactor Remaining Core Services**
   - Apply the repository pattern to BillService and PaymentService
   - Update service tests to use the new pattern
   - Ensure proper validation flow in all services
   - Maintain backward compatibility with existing code

2. **Update API Dependency Injection**
   - Update API endpoints to use the refactored services
   - Create dedicated service provider functions
   - Update API tests to use the new dependencies
   - Ensure proper error handling at the API level

3. **Complete Repository Error Handling**
   - Implement custom repository exceptions
   - Add error translation in services
   - Update tests to verify error handling behavior
   - Document exception handling patterns

## Implementation Lessons

1. **Service-Repository Boundary**
   - Services own business logic and validation
   - Repositories focus solely on data access patterns
   - Clear separation improves testability and maintainability
   - Pydantic schemas provide the boundary between layers

2. **Testing with Real Database Fixtures**
   - Using real database fixtures is preferable to mocks
   - Real fixtures validate actual behavior and catch integration issues
   - Following the Arrange-Schema-Act-Assert pattern ensures proper validation flow
   - Fixtures should be reusable across multiple test cases
