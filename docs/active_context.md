## Implementation Lessons

1. **Polymorphic Repository Pattern**
   - Use specialized base repository for polymorphic entities (`PolymorphicBaseRepository`)
   - Disable base `create` and `update` methods with `NotImplementedError` to prevent incorrect usage
   - Implement type-specific creation and update methods (`create_typed_entity`, `update_typed_entity`)
   - Always use concrete subclasses that match the intended polymorphic type
   - Integrate with type registries for proper model class lookup
   - Implement automatic field validation and filtering based on model class
   - Ensure proper type handling and identity management
   - Prevent setting invalid fields that don't exist on specific model classes
   - Use consistent interface for all polymorphic repositories
   - Design for future expansion to support any number of polymorphic entity types
   - Preserve optional fields with existing values during partial updates
   - Skip setting optional fields to NULL if they already have a value

2. **Repository Fixture Usage Patterns**
   - Use repository_factory as a function, not as an object with methods
   - Understand the difference between class-based and function-based fixtures
   - Ensure consistent fixture usage patterns across similar repository types
   - Verify fixture implementation matches usage in tests
   - Document fixture usage patterns for team reference

3. **Repository Test Organization**
   - Separate CRUD tests from advanced repository tests
   - Place basic CRUD operations (create, get, update, delete) in crud/ directory
   - Place specialized operations in advanced/ directory
   - Maintain consistent test naming across similar repository types
   - Follow established patterns from working test files

4. **Feature Flag System Architecture**
   - Centralize feature flag enforcement at architectural boundaries instead of scattering checks
   - Use proxy/interceptor patterns to separate business logic from feature gating
   - Implement domain-specific exceptions for better error handling and clarity
   - Store both flag values AND requirements in the database for runtime configuration
   - Use caching with appropriate TTL for performance optimization
   - Implement account type extraction to support feature flags for specific account types
   - Follow bottom-up implementation approach starting at repository layer
   - Ensure consistent async/await patterns throughout the system
   - Use cache-aware testing strategies to handle TTL caching effects
   - Provide zero-TTL options for testing environments to avoid race conditions
   - Add helper utilities for clear cache invalidation when needed
   - Implement proper inspection of async methods to avoid mismatches

5. **Test Consolidation for Complete Coverage**
   - Analyze coverage reports to identify specific uncovered lines and branches
   - Combine complementary test files that cover different parts of the same functionality
   - Create targeted tests for specific edge cases that are missed by existing tests
   - Use descriptive test names that clearly indicate what scenario is being tested
   - Maintain all existing test functionality when consolidating test files
   - Focus on branch coverage for conditional logic, especially in financial calculations
   - Test both positive and negative scenarios for complete coverage
   - Verify coverage with specific coverage reports after changes

6. **Model Fixture Standardization**
   - Use naive_utc_now() for all database datetime fields instead of utc_now().replace(tzinfo=None)
   - Always use db_session.flush() instead of db_session.commit() in fixtures
   - Add comprehensive Args and Returns sections to all fixture docstrings

   - Use timezone-aware functions for business logic (e.g., utc_now(), days_ago())
   - Convert between naive and aware only at the database boundary
   - Use clear variable naming to distinguish between naive and aware datetimes (e.g., db_date vs. aware_date)
   - Document the use of naive datetimes in function docstrings
   - Use naive functions when creating test fixtures for database models
   - Use timezone-aware functions when testing business logic
   - Be explicit about which type of datetime is expected in assertions

9. **Schema Factory Test Determinism**
