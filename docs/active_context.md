# Active Context: Debtonator

## Current Focus
Completing Repository Layer Implementation (ADR-014)

### Recent Changes

1. **Completed All Repository Implementations** ✓
   - Implemented CreditLimitHistoryRepository for tracking credit limit changes
   - Created BalanceReconciliationRepository for managing balance reconciliations
   - Added TransactionHistoryRepository for transaction tracking
   - Enhanced BaseRepository with bulk_update and transaction support
   - Added specialized methods for each repository following consistent patterns

2. **Created Comprehensive Repository Tests** ✓
   - Implemented tests for all new repositories following the 4-step pattern
   - Added validation error testing for each repository
   - Created fixtures and test data generation for thorough testing
   - Ensured all tests pass data through Pydantic schemas first

3. **Enhanced Schema Factory Functions** ✓
   - Added factory functions for CreditLimitHistory, BalanceReconciliation, and TransactionHistory
   - Made factory functions configurable with sensible defaults
   - Ensured proper validation flow in test code
   - Used model_dump() consistently to convert schemas to dicts

4. **Updated Dependency Injection Setup** ✓
   - Added dependency provider functions for all new repositories
   - Maintained consistent pattern across all repositories
   - Connected repositories to dependency injection system
   - Ensured proper session management across dependencies

5. **Completed the Repository Testing Pattern** ✓
   - Finalized the Arrange-Schema-Act-Assert pattern across all tests
   - Ensured proper validation flow in all test modules
   - Added tests for transaction boundaries and error handling
   - Implemented tests for advanced querying features

## Next Steps

1. **Begin Service Layer Refactoring**
   - Start with AccountService as proof of concept
   - Update service to use repository pattern
   - Create unit tests using mock repositories
   - Update API endpoints to use refactored service

2. **Complete Unit Tests for BaseRepository**
   - Create dedicated unit tests for BaseRepository
   - Test all CRUD operations with controlled fixtures
   - Ensure proper coverage of filtering and pagination
   - Test transaction handling and error scenarios

3. **Create Repository Documentation**
   - Document common patterns and best practices
   - Create usage examples for repositories
   - Document repository interfaces and methods
   - Create examples of service-repository integration

## Implementation Lessons

1. **Repository Transaction Pattern**
   - Using async context managers for transaction boundaries provides a clean API
   - Context managers handle both commit and rollback cases automatically
   - This pattern enables method chaining within transaction blocks
   - Transactions should be managed at the service layer, not within repositories

2. **Factory Function Design**
   - Factory functions should have sensible defaults but allow overrides
   - Use optional parameters with None defaults for flexibility
   - Calculate derived fields within the factory when possible
   - Document factory function usage patterns for team reference
