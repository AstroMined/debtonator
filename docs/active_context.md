Implementing Repository Layer (ADR-014)

### Recent Changes

1. **Completed Schema Factory Improvements** ✓
   - Fixed missing schema factories for comprehensive coverage:
     - liabilities.py: Added factories for `LiabilityInDB`, `LiabilityResponse`, `LiabilityDateRange`, `AutoPaySettings`, and `AutoPayUpdate`

     - recommendations.py: Created complete factory implementation
   - Implemented proper validation for complex schemas
   - Added robust default values for simpler testing
   - Enhanced support for nested schemas and relationships
   - Improved UTC timezone handling across all factories

2. **Completed All Missing Schema Factories** ✓
   - Implemented factories for all remaining schema types:
     - categories.py: Added factory for category creation and updates
     - payment_patterns.py: Created comprehensive factory functions for pattern analysis
     - payment_schedules.py: Implemented payment schedule schema factories
     - cashflow/: Created complete directory structure with factories for:
       - base.py: Basic cashflow models
       - metrics.py: Financial metrics models
       - account_analysis.py: Account analysis models
       - forecasting.py: Forecasting-related models
       - historical.py: Historical trend models
     - impact_analysis.py: Added factories for impact analysis models
     - income_trends.py: Created factories for income trend analysis

   - All factories follow standard decorator pattern and naming conventions
   - Added proper nested factory support for complex models
   - Maintained consistent hierarchical structure for module organization
   - Provided rich default values for simpler test setup

3. **Created New Schema Factories for Additional Entities**
   - Added 6 new schema factories for previously unsupported entities:
     - balance_history.py: Created factory for balance tracking 
     - income.py: Implemented factories for income and recurring income
     - statement_history.py: Added support for credit statement histories
     - recurring_bills.py: Created factory for recurring bill patterns
     - deposit_schedules.py: Added factory for deposit scheduling
     - income_categories.py: Created simple category factory 
   - All factories follow the decorator pattern for validated schema creation
   - Maintained consistent naming and documentation standards
   - Included proper timezone-aware handling for datetime fields
   - Added appropriate field validations and default values

4. **Removed Schema Factories Backward Compatibility**
   - Eliminated façade pattern from schema_factories for cleaner imports
   - Updated all factory files to use the decorator pattern consistently
   - Enhanced base utilities with improved typing and constants
   - Fixed CreditLimitHistoryUpdate schema to include required effective_date 
   - Standardized factory return types and docstrings
   - Added comprehensive migration guide in README.md
   - Updated all factories to match current schema requirements
   - Maintained clear "_schema" suffix naming convention for clarity

5. **Implemented Missing Repositories for ADR-014**
   - Created PaymentScheduleRepository with 14 specialized methods
   - Implemented DepositScheduleRepository with 15 specialized methods
   - Added dependency injection for both repositories in API layer
   - Updated ADR-014 implementation checklist with detailed progress tracking
   - Followed established repository patterns for consistent implementation
   - Added comprehensive relationship loading with joinedload/selectinload
   - Implemented detailed docstrings with parameter and return type documentation
   - Ensured proper error handling for invalid inputs

## Next Steps

1. **Implement Remaining Repositories**
   - Create RecurringIncomeRepository following established patterns
   - Implement IncomeCategoryRepository for income categorization
   - Develop CashflowForecastRepository for financial projections
   - Update dependency injection for new repositories
   - Ensure consistency with existing repository implementations

2. **Create Tests for New Repositories**
   - Implement schema factories for PaymentSchedule and DepositSchedule models
   - Create test files following Arrange-Schema-Act-Assert pattern
   - Test all specialized repository methods
   - Validate error handling and edge cases
   - Ensure proper transaction handling in tests

3. **Service Layer Integration**
   - Create/update services to use the new repositories
   - Implement proper validation flow with Pydantic schemas
   - Develop integration tests for service-repository interaction
   - Ensure transaction boundaries are respected
   - Add service-level error handling for repository operations

## Implementation Lessons

1. **Repository Implementation Patterns**
   - Follow consistent method naming conventions across repositories
   - Group related functionality (e.g., getters with relationship loading)
   - Use type annotations consistently for better code readability
   - Implement proper error handling for edge cases
   - Include comprehensive docstrings for all methods
   - Follow SQLAlchemy best practices for relationship loading

2. **Repository Method Design**
   - Keep primary query methods simple and focused
   - Use optional parameters to enhance flexibility
   - Support filtering by key attributes (date, account, status)
   - Include relationship loading options where appropriate
   - Return consistent types for similar methods across repositories
   - Provide total calculation methods for financial summaries

3. **SQLAlchemy Query Optimization**
   - Use selectinload for one-to-many relationships
   - Use joinedload for many-to-one relationships
   - Build queries incrementally for better readability
   - Add appropriate ordering for predictable results
   - Use aliased classes for complex joins when needed
   - Optimize relationship loading to prevent N+1 query issues

4. **Repository Testing Considerations**
   - Create specific test cases for each method
   - Test both positive and negative scenarios
   - Validate relationship loading behavior
   - Ensure proper transaction handling
   - Test data retrieval and manipulation methods separately
   - Use schema factories to create valid test data
