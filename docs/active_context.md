# Active Context: Debtonator

## Current Focus
Frontend development setup completed. Core bills, income, and cashflow API endpoints have been implemented. Moving forward with frontend component development.

## Recent Analysis

### API Implementation
1. **Income API**
   - CRUD operations completed
   - Deposit status tracking
   - Undeposited amount calculations
   - Date range filtering
   - Source categorization
   - Relationship with transactions

2. **Cashflow API**
   - 90-day rolling forecast
   - Minimum required funds tracking
   - Deficit calculations
   - Required income projections
   - Hourly rate calculations
   - Account balance tracking

3. **Formula Translations**
   - Income calculations implemented
     ```python
     undeposited_amount = amount if not deposited else Decimal(0)
     ```
   - Cashflow calculations implemented
     ```python
     daily_deficit = min_amount / 14 if min_amount < 0 else Decimal(0)
     yearly_deficit = daily_deficit * 365
     required_income = abs(yearly_deficit) / Decimal('0.8')
     hourly_rate = required_income / 52 / hours_per_week
     ```

## Known Issues

### Data Migration Challenges
- Date format conversions (handling dates from 2017-2025)
- Formula translations (especially SUMPRODUCT and complex IF conditions)
- Historical data preservation (maintaining 8+ years of records)
- Data validation rules
- Account balance history reconstruction
- Payment status history preservation
- Auto-pay configuration migration

### Technical Challenges
- Real-time calculations
- Mobile responsiveness
- State management
- Performance optimization

## Current Questions
1. How to handle real-time updates efficiently?
2. Best approach for recurring bill creation?
3. Optimal state management solution?
4. Most efficient way to implement calculations?
5. How to handle historical vs future dates in calculations?
6. What's the best way to track payment method changes?
7. How to maintain account balance accuracy with pending transactions?
8. Should we maintain the 80% tax consideration in income requirements?
9. How to handle bill amount changes for recurring bills?
10. What's the best way to implement the 14/30/60/90 day forecasting?
