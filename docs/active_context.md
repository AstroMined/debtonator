5. **Update Test Cases for Polymorphic Validation**
   - Extend test coverage for the new Pydantic v2 discriminated union pattern
   - Create comprehensive test cases for all account types
   - Test proper handling of inheritance and discriminator fields

## Implementation Lessons

1. **Schema Factory Test Determinism**
   - Avoid random behavior in tests that can lead to intermittent failures
   - Use explicit parameters to control test behavior (e.g., include_seasonality)
   - Create separate test cases for different scenarios instead of random behavior
   - Implement proper test coverage for both positive and negative cases
   - Use random behavior tests only for verifying distribution, not for functional testing
   - Add clear parameter documentation to make test control obvious

2. **Repository Test Decoupling**
   - Create test-specific models and schemas for testing generic functionality
   - Avoid using business models in tests for generic components
   - Use schema factories to simplify test data creation
   - Follow the Arrange-Schema-Act-Assert pattern consistently
   - Create reusable test fixtures for common test scenarios
   - Implement proper validation flow in all repository tests

3. **Schema Factory Test Edge Cases**
   - Watch for subtle rounding issues in decimal sum assertions (e.g., day_of_month_patterns sum)
   - Verify enum member existence before using in tests to prevent AttributeError
   - Use appropriate assertions for optional fields that may be None but still exist
   - Implement proper tolerance ranges for numerical tests where exact equality isn't required
   - Test both None and explicit values for optional fields

4. **Schema Factory Nested Object Handling**
   - Use explicit dictionary structure for nested objects to match schema expectations
   - Handle multi-level nested dictionaries carefully with clear structure documentation
   - Test each level of nesting individually and with custom values
   - Create specific test assertions for each level of the object structure
   - Verify schema validation with complex nested structures

5. **Datetime Handling for Test Assertions**
   - Always use datetime_equals() for comparing datetime objects to ensure proper TZ handling
   - Verify all datetimes have timezone info (tzinfo is not None)
   - Confirm timezone is UTC (tzinfo == timezone.utc) as required by ADR-011
   - Test both auto-created and explicitly provided datetime values
   - Verify proper date difference calculations in nested object structures
