   - Fix null handling in balance_history_repository_advanced
   - Fix attribute references in income_category_repository_advanced
   - Fix decimal precision issues in transaction_history_repository_advanced

3. **Complete UTC Datetime Compliance**
   - Add naive datetime scanner to CI pipeline for continuous monitoring
   - Add utility functions to production code for consistent datetime handling
   - Create PR with completed Phase 1 fixes

4. **Implement PaymentSource Schema Simplification (ADR-017)**
   - Simplify the schema architecture
   - Remove technical debt from the dual schema approach
   - Update all related tests and repositories

## Implementation Lessons

1. **DateTime Testing Patterns**
   - Always use timezone-aware datetime objects in tests with explicitly set UTC timezone
   - Use helper utilities like `utc_now()` and `days_from_now()` for consistent test datetimes
   - When comparing dates, use `datetime_equals()` and `datetime_greater_than()` helpers
   - Avoid direct attribute comparison like `obj1.date > obj2.date` for timezone-aware dates
   - Handle microsecond precision with the ignore_microseconds parameter in comparisons
   - Include asserts with "or equals" conditions to handle edge cases properly
   - Use day/month manipulation helpers to prevent "day out of range" errors

2. **Repository Test Approach**
   - Date range queries require special attention to timezone handling
   - Edge cases around midnight/month boundaries need additional checks
   - Calculations should be performed consistently within a timezone context
   - Test assertion logic should match repository implementation exactly
   - Consistent repository test pattern improves maintainability
