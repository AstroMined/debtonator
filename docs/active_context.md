# Active Context: Debtonator

## Current Focus
Optimizing frontend performance and state management, with a particular focus on the Bills components. The system now provides better performance through optimized rendering and efficient state updates.

### Recent Implementation
1. **Bills Component Performance Optimization**
   - Enhanced memoization with useCallback for event handlers
   - Improved Redux integration with type-safe hooks
   - Optimized bulk payment updates with batch processing
   - Added optimistic updates for better UX
   - Improved error handling with local error state

2. **State Management Improvements**
   - Enhanced TypeScript type safety
   - Reduced unnecessary re-renders
   - Better state management for pending updates
   - Efficient data fetching with proper loading states
   - Implemented batch processing for bulk operations

3. **Documentation**
   - Updated changelog with performance improvements
   - Enhanced TypeScript type definitions
   - Documented optimistic update patterns
   - Added performance optimization guidelines
