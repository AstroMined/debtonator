### Previous Changes
1. **Reverted ConstrainedDecimal Implementation Due to Pydantic V2 Incompatibility** ✓
   - Identified critical compatibility issue with our decimal precision implementation:
     * The `ConstrainedDecimal` class used in our implementation has been removed in Pydantic V2
     * This caused import errors that broke the application completely

### Implementation Lessons
1. **Pydantic V2 Compatibility Considerations are Critical**
   - Major breaking changes in Pydantic V2 require significant attention:
     * `ConstrainedDecimal` and other "constrained" classes were removed entirely
     * Many validation approaches from V1 are no longer supported
     * The recommended Annotated types pattern is significantly different
   - This situation highlights key project maintenance considerations:
     * Stay informed about major dependency updates and breaking changes
     * Test with newer library versions before committing to implementation patterns
     * Have a clear rollback strategy for critical dependencies
     * Document expected compatibility range for implementations
   - The Pydantic V2 migration requires careful planning:
     * Annotated types offer a more standardized approach
     * Field validation requires new patterns
     * Error messages and validation behavior may change
     * Documentation needs to be updated to reflect new patterns
   - These lessons inform our long-term dependency strategy:
     * Pin critical dependencies to specific versions
     * Test with "next" versions before upgrading
     * Document compatibility requirements in ADRs
     * Have clear migration plans for major version upgrades

2. **Dictionary Validation Requires Special Attention**
   - Dictionary fields present unique validation challenges:
     * Simple type aliases don't enforce validation for dictionary values
     * JSON deserialization doesn't automatically validate each value
     * Nested structures need special handling
     * In-place modifications might bypass validation
   - Our solution involves multiple strategies:
     * Model validators to check dictionary values after parsing
     * Custom dictionary classes with validation in `__setitem__`
     * Comprehensive testing for dictionary validation
     * Clear documentation of validation behavior
   - This approach provides several benefits:
     * Robust validation for all dictionary fields
     * Clear error messages for validation failures
     * Consistent behavior with other validation patterns
     * Proper handling of nested structures

3. **Type Annotations Improve Code Clarity**
   - The Annotated types approach offers significant improvements:
     * Field constraints are declared alongside the field definition
     * Types carry their validation rules with them
     * Clearer mental model for developers
     * Better IDE support and type hints
   - This approach aligns with modern Python practices:
     * Leverages Python's typing system for validation
     * Uses Pydantic's design patterns effectively
     * Provides a clear path for future enhancements
     * Simplifies validation logic and reduces technical debt

3. **No Further Action Items Required for ADR-013**
   - ADR-013 implementation is now 100% complete

## Next Steps
1. **Implement Repository Layer Based on ADR-014**
   - Create `src/repositories` directory with base implementation
   - Implement BaseRepository with generic CRUD operations
   - Add model-specific repositories for core models
   - Develop integration tests with real database fixtures
   - Refactor one service as proof-of-concept

2. **Continue Implementation of Repository Pattern**
   - Complete repositories for all models
   - Gradually refactor services to use repositories
   - Update API endpoints to use refactored services
   - Migrate existing tests to new architecture
   - Add specialized repository methods for common queries

3. **Resume API Enhancement Project - Phase 6**
   - Implement recommendations API using the new architecture
   - Continue trend reporting development with the repository pattern
   - Proceed with frontend development leveraging improved backend
   - Create comprehensive API documentation

4. **Improve Developer Experience**
   - Add IDE snippets for repository pattern
   - Document repository pattern usage
   - Enhance API documentation
   - Create tutorials for working with repositories
