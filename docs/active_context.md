   - Implement remaining error classes for account types
   - Create consistent error translation between layers
   - Add user-friendly error messages to API responses
   - Implement error handling middleware for API endpoints
   - Add comprehensive documentation for error handling patterns

2. **Complete Schema Factory Test Coverage**
   - Implement remaining tests for account_types schema factories
   - Add tests for cashflow/forecasting.py and cashflow/historical.py
   - Create test file for cashflow/base.py with proper validation
   - Implement tests for income_trends.py schema factory
   - Expand tests for complex nested structures

3. **Fix Remaining Schema Factory Implementation Issues**
   - Address validator conflict with discriminator fields in response models
   - Ensure proper handling of field validators in discriminated unions
   - Move complex validation logic to service layer where needed
   - Add robust handling for nested discriminated union validation

   - Create GET /banking/upcoming-payments endpoint
   - Add POST /accounts/banking endpoint
   - Implement POST /accounts/bnpl/{account_id}/update-status endpoint
   - Create endpoints to retrieve available account types

5. **Update Test Cases for Polymorphic Validation**
   - Extend test coverage for the new Pydantic v2 discriminated union pattern
   - Create comprehensive test cases for all account types
   - Test proper handling of inheritance and discriminator fields

## Implementation Lessons

1. **Error Class Parameter Standardization**
   - Ensure error class parameters match between implementation and tests
   - Use consistent parameter naming across related error classes
   - Document parameter expectations clearly in docstrings
   - Implement proper inheritance relationships for error classes
   - Test both basic and detailed error instantiation patterns

2. **Error Message Formatting**
   - Be careful with message formatting when combining custom messages with default templates
   - Test error message formatting with various parameter combinations
   - Ensure error details dictionary contains all relevant information
   - Implement consistent string representation for error classes
   - Test error serialization to dictionaries for API responses

3. **Schema Factory Nested Object Handling**
   - Use explicit dictionary structure for nested objects to match schema expectations
   - Handle multi-level nested dictionaries carefully with clear structure documentation
   - Test each level of nesting individually and with custom values
   - Create specific test assertions for each level of the object structure
   - Verify schema validation with complex nested structures

4. **Complex Schema Test Structure Pattern**
   - Create modular test files for each schema factory area
   - Test all factory functions including helper factories for nested objects
   - Include a main default test and a custom values test for each factory
   - Add specific tests for edge cases like boundary values
   - Document expectations for nested structure validation

5. **Testing and Error Handling for Schema Factories**
   - Focus on validating schema objects against their expected structure
   - Test boundary conditions and expected validation errors
   - Document clear examples of valid object structures
   - Ensure error messages are specific and helpful
   - Add test cases for each potential validation failure
