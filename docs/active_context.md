# Active Context: Debtonator

## Current Focus
API Enhancement Project - Phase 6: Reporting & Analysis

### Recent Changes
1. **Datetime Standardization (In Progress)**
   - ✓ Updated schemas:
     * Impact analysis schema using timezone-aware datetime

   - ✓ Implemented account-specific forecast service
   - ✓ Added recurring bill handling
   - ✓ Added credit utilization tracking
   - ✓ Implemented warning flags system
   - ✓ Added confidence scoring
   - ✓ Added comprehensive test coverage
   - ✓ Fixed all test failures

### Recent Decisions
1. **Implementation Strategy**
   - Decimal precision handling for financial calculations
   - Comprehensive pattern detection with confidence scoring
   - Strong type safety throughout
   - Proper error handling
   - Improved test coverage
   - Account-level risk assessment
   - Focus payment pattern analysis on bill-specific patterns
   - Plan for separate expense pattern analysis service
   - Decision to update datetime handling in schemas to maintain timezone information
   - Identified need to update HistoricalPeriodAnalysis and related schemas to use datetime instead of date
