# Active Context: Debtonator

## Current Focus
Frontend layout foundation completed with Material-UI. Moving forward with feature-specific component development for bills, income, and cashflow management.

## Recent Analysis

### Frontend Layout Implementation
1. **Material-UI Integration**
   - Custom theme configuration
   - Component style overrides
   - Responsive design patterns
   - Typography system

2. **Navigation System**
   - Top app bar with mobile menu
   - Responsive sidebar
   - Mobile-friendly drawer
   - Navigation routing structure

3. **Layout Components**
   ```typescript
   // Component hierarchy
   AppLayout
   ├── Navigation
   ├── Sidebar
   └── PageContainer
   ```

### API Implementation
1. **Income API**
   - CRUD operations completed
   - Deposit status tracking
   - Undeposited amount calculations
   - Date range filtering
   - Source categorization
   - Relationship with transactions

2. **Cashflow API**
   - 90-day rolling forecast
   - Minimum required funds tracking
   - Deficit calculations
   - Required income projections
   - Hourly rate calculations
   - Account balance tracking

3. **Formula Translations**
   - Income calculations implemented
     ```python
     undeposited_amount = amount if not deposited else Decimal(0)
     ```
   - Cashflow calculations implemented
     ```python
     daily_deficit = min_amount / 14 if min_amount < 0 else Decimal(0)
     yearly_deficit = daily_deficit * 365
     required_income = abs(yearly_deficit) / Decimal('0.8')
     hourly_rate = required_income / 52 / hours_per_week
     ```
