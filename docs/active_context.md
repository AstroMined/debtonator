## Current Focus
Repository Layer Integration Tests (ADR-014), Breaking Circular Test Dependencies, Direct Model Instantiation

### Recent Changes

1. **Refactored Test Fixtures to Use Direct SQLAlchemy Model Instantiation** ✓
   - Replaced repository-based fixture data creation with direct SQLAlchemy model instantiation
   - Fixed circular dependency issues where repository tests were using fixtures that themselves used repositories
   - Updated fixtures in income, payments, recurring, schedules, statements, and transactions fixture files
   - Removed repository dependencies from fixtures completely
   - Used db_session directly in fixtures for model instantiation
   - Properly handled relationships with the flush-then-refresh pattern
   - Ensured test fixtures use the correct field names matching actual model fields
   - Applied consistent pattern for timezone handling with naive datetimes for DB storage

2. **Fixed Model Field Name Mismatches in Fixtures** ✓
   - Corrected `old_limit`/`new_limit` to `credit_limit` in CreditLimitHistory fixtures
   - Changed `account_type` to `type` in Account fixtures
   - Removed `balance_after` from TransactionHistory fixtures
   - Removed non-existent `category` field from TransactionHistory
   - Fixed field names across all fixture files to match actual database model field names
   - Identified business logic leakage from repositories into the data access layer
   - Documented schema vs. repository responsibilities for better architecture
   - Improved test isolation by removing repository dependencies

3. **Enhanced SQLAlchemy Relationship Handling in Fixtures** ✓
   - Implemented proper parent-child relationship handling in fixtures
   - Used the flush-then-refresh pattern consistently for relationship establishment
   - Added explicit db_session.refresh() after flush for all related objects
   - Improved nested object creation with proper ID assignment
   - Fixed relationship handling for complex objects like payment sources
   - Used proper SQLAlchemy session management in all fixtures
   - Ensured test data integrity with proper relationship loading
   - Maintained same test functionality despite implementation change

4. **Improved Datetime Handling in Test Fixtures** ✓
   - Consistently used `.replace(tzinfo=None)` for all datetime objects in fixtures
   - Ensured all datetime fields store naive datetimes as required by SQLAlchemy
   - Fixed timezone handling with proper conversion to naive UTC datetimes
   - Applied consistent pattern for datetime creation and storage
   - Maintained compatibility with database requirements for datetime fields
   - Fixed timezone issues in test fixtures for statements and transactions
   - Added explicit comments about naive datetime usage for DB storage
   - Applied consistent datetime pattern across all fixture files

5. **Fixed Architecture Layer Separation** ✓
   - Eliminated repository business logic leaking into test fixtures
   - Properly separated data access layer from validation layer
   - Fixed circular dependencies where repository tests depended on repositories
   - Found and documented inappropriate field validation in repositories
   - Improved test integrity by making test fixtures independent of the systems they test
   - Identified areas where business logic was inappropriately placed in repositories
   - Enhanced architecture layer separation with proper responsibility boundaries
   - Removed schema factories from fixture creation for cleaner separation

## Next Steps

1. **Continue Phase 2: Database Integrity Issues**
   - Fix NOT NULL constraint failures in category_repository_advanced tests
   - Fix relationship loading issues in liability_repository_advanced
   - Fix assertion issues in recurring_bill_repository_advanced
   - Fix category-income relationships in income_category_repository_advanced

2. **Continue Phase 3: Nullability and Type Issues**
   - Fix decimal arithmetic with None values in account_repository_advanced
   - Fix null handling in balance_history_repository_advanced
   - Fix attribute references in income_category_repository_advanced
   - Fix decimal precision issues in transaction_history_repository_advanced

3. **Update Repository Tests to Support Direct Model Instantiation**
   - Revise test assertions to match updated fixture behavior
   - Fix any remaining field name mismatches in test assertions
   - Update expected values to match the direct model approach
   - Fix test setup that assumes repository-based fixture creation

4. **Create ADR Documenting the Test Fixture Architecture**
   - Document the direct SQLAlchemy model instantiation pattern
   - Outline best practices for fixture creation
   - Define responsibility boundaries between fixtures and repositories
   - Create guidance for handling relationships in fixtures

## Implementation Lessons

1. **Test Fixture Architecture**
   - Create test fixtures using direct SQLAlchemy model instantiation rather than repositories
   - Use db_session directly for model creation, flushing, and refreshing
   - Handle relationships using the flush-then-refresh pattern
   - Ensure field names in fixtures exactly match database model field names
   - Convert aware datetimes to naive with `.replace(tzinfo=None)` for SQLAlchemy storage
   - Implement standard refresh pattern to ensure all relationship data is loaded
   - Create independent fixtures that don't depend on the systems they're testing

2. **SQLAlchemy Relationship Handling**
   - For parent-child relationships, create parent first, flush to get ID, then create children
   - Always refresh parent objects after creating children to load relationships
   - Use separate flush operations for different hierarchy levels
   - Maintain proper ordering when creating related objects
   - Use session.flush() instead of commit() in fixtures for better transaction control
   - Directly set foreign key fields with appropriate IDs after flushing parent objects
   - Use single db_session object consistently throughout fixtures

3. **Architecture Layer Separation**
   - Repositories should contain minimal business logic
   - Field validation belongs in the schema layer, not repositories
   - Test fixtures should be independent of the systems they test
   - Direct model instantiation avoids circular dependencies in testing
   - Proper separation of concerns improves test reliability and maintainability
   - Repository tests should test repositories, not schema validation
   - Business logic should live in the service layer, not repositories
