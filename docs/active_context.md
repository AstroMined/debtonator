## Next Steps

1. **Complete Error Handling System Implementation**
   - Implement remaining error classes for account types
   - Create consistent error translation between layers
   - Add user-friendly error messages to API responses
   - Implement error handling middleware for API endpoints
   - Add comprehensive documentation for error handling patterns

2. **Complete Schema Factory Test Coverage**
   - Implement remaining tests for account_types schema factories
   - Increase test coverage for specific schema factory components with < 90% coverage
   - Improve test coverage for complex edge cases in nested structures
   - Add cross-factory integration testing for complex relationships
   - Implement tests for additional service-level schema validations

3. **Fix Remaining Schema Factory Implementation Issues**
   - Address validator conflict with discriminator fields in response models
   - Ensure proper handling of field validators in discriminated unions
   - Move complex validation logic to service layer where needed
   - Add robust handling for nested discriminated union validation
   - Document proper schema-service validation patterns

4. **Complete API Layer Integration**
   - Implement GET /banking/overview endpoint
   - Create GET /banking/upcoming-payments endpoint
   - Add POST /accounts/banking endpoint
   - Implement POST /accounts/bnpl/{account_id}/update-status endpoint
   - Create endpoints to retrieve available account types

5. **Update Test Cases for Polymorphic Validation**
   - Extend test coverage for the new Pydantic v2 discriminated union pattern
   - Create comprehensive test cases for all account types
   - Test proper handling of inheritance and discriminator fields

## Implementation Lessons

1. **Repository Test Decoupling**
   - Create test-specific models and schemas for testing generic functionality
   - Avoid using business models in tests for generic components
   - Use schema factories to simplify test data creation
   - Follow the Arrange-Schema-Act-Assert pattern consistently
   - Create reusable test fixtures for common test scenarios
   - Implement proper validation flow in all repository tests

2. **Schema Factory Test Edge Cases**
   - Watch for subtle rounding issues in decimal sum assertions (e.g., day_of_month_patterns sum)
   - Verify enum member existence before using in tests to prevent AttributeError
   - Use appropriate assertions for optional fields that may be None but still exist
   - Implement proper tolerance ranges for numerical tests where exact equality isn't required
   - Test both None and explicit values for optional fields

3. **Schema Factory Nested Object Handling**
   - Use explicit dictionary structure for nested objects to match schema expectations
   - Handle multi-level nested dictionaries carefully with clear structure documentation
   - Test each level of nesting individually and with custom values
   - Create specific test assertions for each level of the object structure
   - Verify schema validation with complex nested structures

4. **Datetime Handling for Test Assertions**
   - Always use datetime_equals() for comparing datetime objects to ensure proper TZ handling
   - Verify all datetimes have timezone info (tzinfo is not None)
   - Confirm timezone is UTC (tzinfo == timezone.utc) as required by ADR-011
   - Test both auto-created and explicitly provided datetime values
   - Verify proper date difference calculations in nested object structures

5. **Complex Enum Handling**
   - Explicitly import and use proper enum values (e.g., FrequencyType.WEEKLY)
   - Verify enum members exist in the enumeration before using in tests
   - Test all valid enum values to ensure complete coverage
   - Carefully handle string-based enums with proper literals
   - Test proper validation behavior when using invalid enum values
