     - SQLAlchemy warnings: "Flushing object with incompatible polymorphic identity"
     - Repository methods creating base `Account` objects instead of specialized types like `BNPLAccount`
     - Type assertion failures (`isinstance`) in tests due to incorrect object instantiation
     - Feature flag validation bypassed in some test flows
     - Timezone inconsistency causing "can't compare offset-naive and offset-aware datetimes" errors

     - Found issues in `create_typed_account` method relying on general polymorphic loading
     - Identified incorrect SQLAlchemy session handling (not detaching objects)
     - Determined account type registry is not being used properly in repository methods
     - Found incorrect datetime handling in account type schema validation

     - Updated test_credit_crud.py to use "minimum" instead of "minimum_payment" for autopay_status
     - Updated test_savings_crud.py to use 0.0175 and 0.0225 instead of 1.75 and 2.25 for interest_rate
