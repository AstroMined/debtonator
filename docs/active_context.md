   - Add comprehensive tests for schema-model compatibility
   - Clean up backward compatibility fields as appropriate

   - Add POST /accounts/banking endpoint
   - Create POST /accounts/bnpl/{account_id}/update-status endpoint
   - Add comprehensive documentation with OpenAPI annotations
   - Implement proper schema validation for API responses

## Implementation Lessons

1. **Proper Datetime Handling with ADR-011**
   - Always use the utility functions in datetime_utils.py for consistent timezone handling
   - Use `ensure_utc()` to guarantee timezone awareness when needed
   - Use `.replace(tzinfo=None)` for database operations as SQLAlchemy stores datetimes without timezone
   - For datetime comparisons, use `datetime_equals()` and `datetime_greater_than()` with `ignore_timezone=True`
   - Be cautious with timestamps in tests to ensure proper date range filtering and comparisons
   - Understand the distinction between naive datetimes (for DB) and timezone-aware datetimes (for business logic)

2. **Schema-Model Field Alignment**
   - Keep model fields and schema fields aligned to prevent runtime errors
   - Validate that model fields can accept values from schema fields
   - Consider creating utility tools to verify schema-model compatibility
   - Move type-specific fields to the appropriate subclass schemas
   - Be careful about backward compatibility fields that could cause issues
   - Consider using field validation at the schema level for type-specific fields
   - Use proper inheritance patterns in both models and schemas
   - Ensure proper separation of concerns in the class hierarchy

3. **Schema Factory Implementation Best Practices**
   - Don't silently "fix" invalid input in schema factories - let validation handle it
   - Schema factories should construct valid data structures but not perform validation
   - Let schema validation be handled by the actual schema classes for consistent errors
   - Don't override validation logic in factories - it creates inconsistencies
   - Document expected schema structure clearly in factory function docstrings
   - Consider adding test utility assertions specifically for schema validation

4. **Repository Test Design**
   - Focus on testing behavior, not implementation details
   - Use flexible assertions that can handle minor implementation changes
   - Verify expected values rather than exact implementation details (e.g. check credit values, not timestamps)
   - Use appropriate helper functions from utility modules
   - Make tests more robust by handling edge cases like NULL values
   - For date-based tests, be explicit about timezone handling
   - Test functionality through existing methods rather than adding specialized ones

5. **Polymorphic Repository Pattern**
   - Use specialized base repository for polymorphic entities (`PolymorphicBaseRepository`)
   - Disable base `create` and `update` methods with `NotImplementedError` to prevent incorrect usage
   - Implement type-specific creation and update methods (`create_typed_entity`, `update_typed_entity`)
   - Always use concrete subclasses that match the intended polymorphic type
   - Integrate with type registries for proper model class lookup
   - Implement automatic field validation and filtering based on model class
   - Ensure proper type handling and identity management
   - Prevent setting invalid fields that don't exist on specific model classes
   - Use consistent interface for all polymorphic repositories
   - Design for future expansion to support any number of polymorphic entity types
   - Preserve optional fields with existing values during partial updates
   - Skip setting optional fields to NULL if they already have a value
