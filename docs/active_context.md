   - Fixed CreditLimitHistoryUpdate schema to include required effective_date 
   - Standardized factory return types and docstrings
   - Added comprehensive migration guide in README.md
   - Updated all factories to match current schema requirements
   - Maintained clear "_schema" suffix naming convention for clarity

5. **Implemented Missing Repositories for ADR-014**
   - Created PaymentScheduleRepository with 14 specialized methods
   - Implemented DepositScheduleRepository with 15 specialized methods
   - Added dependency injection for both repositories in API layer
   - Updated ADR-014 implementation checklist with detailed progress tracking
   - Followed established repository patterns for consistent implementation
   - Added comprehensive relationship loading with joinedload/selectinload
   - Implemented detailed docstrings with parameter and return type documentation
   - Ensured proper error handling for invalid inputs

## Next Steps

1. **Create Repository Tests**
   - Create integration tests for all new repositories
   - Follow Arrange-Schema-Act-Assert pattern
   - Ensure test coverage for specialized methods
   - Validate relationship loading behavior
   - Test error handling for edge cases

2. **Service Layer Integration**
   - Refactor services to use repositories
   - Update API endpoints to use refactored services
   - Implement proper validation flow
   - Ensure transaction boundaries are respected
   - Add service-level error handling

3. **Documentation Updates**
   - Create comprehensive documentation for all repositories
   - Update API documentation to reflect repository usage
   - Document common repository usage patterns
   - Create examples of service-repository integration

## Implementation Lessons

1. **Repository Implementation Patterns**
   - Follow consistent method naming conventions across repositories
   - Group related functionality (e.g., getters with relationship loading)
   - Use type annotations consistently for better code readability
   - Implement proper error handling for edge cases
   - Include comprehensive docstrings for all methods
   - Follow SQLAlchemy best practices for relationship loading

2. **Repository Method Design**
   - Keep primary query methods simple and focused
   - Use optional parameters to enhance flexibility
   - Support filtering by key attributes (date, account, status)
   - Include relationship loading options where appropriate
   - Return consistent types for similar methods across repositories
   - Provide total calculation methods for financial summaries

3. **SQLAlchemy Query Optimization**
   - Use selectinload for one-to-many relationships
   - Use joinedload for many-to-one relationships
   - Build queries incrementally for better readability
   - Add appropriate ordering for predictable results
   - Use aliased classes for complex joins when needed
   - Optimize relationship loading to prevent N+1 query issues

4. **Repository Testing Considerations**
   - Create specific test cases for each method
   - Test both positive and negative scenarios
   - Validate relationship loading behavior
   - Ensure proper transaction handling
   - Test data retrieval and manipulation methods separately
   - Use schema factories to create valid test data
