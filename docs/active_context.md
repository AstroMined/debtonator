   - Define responsibility boundaries between fixtures and repositories
   - Create guidance for handling relationships in fixtures

## Implementation Lessons

1. **SQL Aggregation Patterns**
   - Use `func.sum(column)` with `group_by()` for proper aggregation
   - For counting with LEFT JOINs, use `func.count(right_table.id)` instead of `func.count()`
   - COUNT(*) counts rows even when joined columns are NULL
   - COUNT(column) only counts non-NULL values of that column
   - This distinction is crucial for accurate counts with OUTER JOINs
   - Always test with empty related tables to verify correct behavior
   - Document SQL aggregation patterns in method docstrings

2. **SQLAlchemy Case Expression Pattern**
   - Use `from sqlalchemy import case` to properly import the case function
   - Use proper syntax for case expressions in SQLAlchemy queries:
   ```python
   func.sum(
       case(
           (Income.deposited == False, 1),
           else_=0
       )
   ).label("pending_count")
   ```
   - Handle boolean expressions in case statements with proper syntax
   - Ensure column labels are properly defined for aggregated results
   - Test complex SQL expressions thoroughly with different inputs

3. **Month Boundary Safe Date Calculation**
   - Use a safe_end_date utility function to handle month boundary issues:
   ```python
   def safe_end_date(today, days):
       """Calculate end date safely handling month transitions."""
       target_date = today + timedelta(days=days)
       year, month = target_date.year, target_date.month
       _, last_day = calendar.monthrange(year, month)
       if target_date.day > last_day:
           return datetime(year, month, last_day, 
                          hour=23, minute=59, second=59, microsecond=999999)
       return datetime(target_date.year, target_date.month, target_date.day,
                     hour=23, minute=59, second=59, microsecond=999999)
   ```
   - Never directly manipulate day component in a datetime object
   - Use calendar.monthrange() to determine the last day of a month
   - Add days using timedelta and then adjust if the result is invalid
   - Handle month transitions properly when calculating end dates

4. **Model Relationship Consistency Pattern**
   - Ensure relationship names are consistent between model definition and usage
   - Update tests to reflect the actual model relationship names
   - Prefer updating tests to match models rather than changing models
   - Use standard SQLAlchemy relationship naming conventions
   - Document relationship names and access patterns in model docstrings
   - Test relationship access explicitly to catch naming inconsistencies
   - When updating model relationships, scan the codebase for all usages

5. **Timezone-aware Datetime Comparison Pattern**
   - Use `datetime_greater_than(date1, date2, ignore_timezone=True)` for date comparisons
   - Use `datetime_equals(date1, date2, ignore_timezone=True)` for date equality checks
   - Use helper functions from tests/helpers/datetime_utils.py consistently
   - Apply `days_ago()` and `days_from_now()` for consistent date range creation
   - Use `utc_now()` instead of `datetime.now(timezone.utc)` for standardization
   - Follow the pattern: `assert (datetime_greater_than(date1, date2, ignore_timezone=True) or datetime_equals(date1, date2, ignore_timezone=True))`
   - Be consistent with timezone handling across all repository tests
   - Remember to add proper imports: `from src.utils.datetime_utils import (utc_now, days_from_now, days_ago, datetime_equals, datetime_greater_than)`

6. **Test Fixture Architecture**
   - Create test fixtures using direct SQLAlchemy model instantiation rather than repositories
   - Use db_session directly for model creation, flushing, and refreshing
   - Handle relationships using the flush-then-refresh pattern
   - Ensure field names in fixtures exactly match database model field names
   - Convert aware datetimes to naive with `.replace(tzinfo=None)` for SQLAlchemy storage
   - Implement standard refresh pattern to ensure all relationship data is loaded
   - Create independent fixtures that don't depend on the systems they're testing
