## Current Focus
Schema Modularization and Test Implementation


### Recent Changes
1. **Schema Modularization Completed** ✓
   - Decomposed large cashflow.py file (974 lines) into five focused modules:
     * `src/schemas/cashflow/base.py` - Core cashflow schemas
     * `src/schemas/cashflow/metrics.py` - Financial metrics schemas
     * `src/schemas/cashflow/account_analysis.py` - Account analysis schemas
     * `src/schemas/cashflow/forecasting.py` - Forecasting schemas
     * `src/schemas/cashflow/historical.py` - Historical analysis schemas
   - Created proper backward-compatible re-export mechanism via `__init__.py`
   - Maintained all ADR-011 and ADR-012 compliance in new module structure
   - Improved code organization for better maintainability
   - Enhanced adherence to Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
   - Simplified future testing by having smaller, focused modules
   - Updated schema_test_implementation_checklist.md to reflect new structure
   - Incurred no breaking changes due to backward compatibility layer

2. **Schema Test Implementation Progress** ✓
   - Implemented three key schema test files:
     * test_realtime_cashflow_schemas.py - Complete test coverage for AccountType, AccountBalance, RealtimeCashflow, and RealtimeCashflowResponse schemas
     * test_recommendations_schemas.py - Comprehensive validation for RecommendationType, ConfidenceLevel, ImpactMetrics, RecommendationBase, BillPaymentTimingRecommendation, and RecommendationResponse
     * test_income_categories_schemas.py - Full test coverage for IncomeCategoryBase, IncomeCategoryCreate, IncomeCategoryUpdate, and IncomeCategory
   - For each test file implemented:
     * Tests for valid object creation with required and optional fields
     * Tests for field validations including required fields and constraints
     * Tests for decimal precision validation where applicable
     * Tests for UTC datetime validation where applicable (per ADR-011)
     * Tests for business rule validations and cross-field validation
     * Proper verification of BaseSchemaValidator inheritance
   - Updated schema_test_implementation_checklist.md to reflect current progress
     * Marked completed test files as done
     * Added notes for N/A test categories where appropriate

3. **Version Information Management** ✓
   - Created src/version.py to provide consistent access to version information:
     * Implemented VERSION_MAJOR, VERSION_MINOR, and VERSION_PATCH constants (0.3.95)
     * Added VERSION string formatted as "MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH" 
     * Added VERSION_TUPLE for structured access to version components
     * Added comprehensive docstrings explaining purpose
   - This allows:
     * Programmatic access to the version information from code
     * Display of version in the UI and API responses
     * Version checks in future CI/CD pipelines
     * Single source of truth for version information
   - Synchronized with existing version in pyproject.toml

### Current Implementation Plan 

#### Schema Test Implementation in Progress
1. **Implemented Test Files (Completed)** ✓
   - [x] tests/schemas/test_realtime_cashflow_schemas.py
     * Comprehensive testing of AccountType enum validation
     * Tests for credit-specific field validation in AccountBalance
     * Tests for account balances uniqueness validation
     * Tests for net position calculation validation
     * Complete UTC datetime validation per ADR-011
   - [x] tests/schemas/test_recommendations_schemas.py
     * Complete tests for impact metrics validation
     * Tests for confidence level and recommendation type enum validation
     * Tests for decimal precision on all monetary fields
     * Tests for datetime UTC validation per ADR-011
     * Tests for value range validation on percentage fields
   - [x] tests/schemas/test_income_categories_schemas.py
     * Tests for all CRUD schema variations (Base, Create, Update, Full)
     * Tests for string length validation on name and description
     * Tests for required fields validation
     * Tests for optional fields handling

2. **Updated schema_test_implementation_checklist.md** ✓
   - [x] Marked 15 of 21 total schema test files as completed
   - [x] Added detailed notes on timezone validation requirements
   - [x] Documented consistent test pattern to follow for remaining files

## Next Steps
1. **Complete Schema Test Implementation**
   - Implement test_cashflow_schemas.py (highest priority due to complexity)
   - Update existing test files with timezone fixes as needed
   - Ensure all remaining schema files have corresponding tests
   - Verify each test file fully validates all schemas and constraints

2. **Resume API Enhancement Project - Phase 6**
   - Implement recommendations API using standardized schemas
   - Continue trend reporting development with improved validation
   - Proceed with frontend development leveraging enhanced schema validation
   - Create comprehensive API documentation with validation requirements

3. **Improve Developer Experience**
   - Add IDE snippets for common schema validation patterns
   - Document version.py usage patterns
   - Enhance API documentation with schema validation requirements
   - Create tutorials for working with the validation system

4. **Implement Compliance Monitoring**
   - Add ADR compliance checks to code review process
   - Update developer onboarding documentation with validation standards
   - Consider static analysis tools to enforce ADR rules
   - Implement scheduled reviews to maintain compliance
