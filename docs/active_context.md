     - Modified test files to use `liability_id` instead of `bill_id` to match schema
     - Updated parameter documentation for clarity
   - Implemented missing repository methods for bill splits:
     - Added `create_bill_splits` with automatic primary account split creation
     - Added `update_bill_splits` for existing splits with transaction support
     - Added `get_splits_by_bill` as an alias to maintain API compatibility
     - Added proper account validation and error handling
   - Enhanced transaction handling and validation:
     - Added transaction boundaries with proper rollback on errors
     - Implemented validation to prevent total splits exceeding bill amount
     - Added specific validation for non-existent accounts
     - Ensured all tests pass consistently

2. **Fixed Banking Account Type Implementations (April 14, 2025)** ✓
   - Added missing fixtures for credit and savings account types:
     - Created `test_credit_with_due_date` and `test_credit_with_rewards` fixtures
     - Created `test_savings_with_interest` and `test_savings_with_min_balance` fixtures
     - Fixed session handling for proper SQLAlchemy relationships

3. **Fixed Schema-Model Field Mismatches in Account Hierarchy (April 14, 2025)** ✓
   - Removed credit-specific fields from base AccountBase schema:
     - Removed available_credit, total_limit, last_statement_balance, and last_statement_date
     - Removed corresponding field validators in both AccountBase and AccountUpdate
   - Added credit-specific fields to CreditAccount model:
     - Added available_credit field with proper Numeric type definition
     - Added total_limit field as an alias for credit_limit for backward compatibility
   - Updated CreditAccountBase schema to ensure all needed fields are explicitly included
   - Fixed test failures in checking_advanced.py related to schema-model mismatch
   - Improved object hierarchy design with better separation of concerns

4. **Refactored Repository Factory Tests (April 14, 2025)** ✓

5. **Fixed Partial Update Field Preservation in PolymorphicBaseRepository (April 13, 2025)** ✓
   - Fixed issue with optional fields not being preserved during partial updates:
     - Modified `update_typed_entity` method to preserve optional fields with existing values
     - Added check to skip setting optional fields to NULL if they already have a value
     - Maintained existing behavior for required fields (never setting them to NULL)
     - Fixed failing test `test_partial_update_preserves_fields` in polymorphic repository tests
   - Enhanced field handling logic in polymorphic repositories:
     - Improved distinction between required and optional fields
     - Added proper handling for fields not explicitly included in update data
     - Maintained type safety with proper field validation
     - Ensured backward compatibility with existing code
   - This fix ensures:
     - Partial updates only modify fields explicitly included in the update data
     - Optional fields with existing values are preserved when not explicitly set to NULL
     - Required fields continue to be protected from NULL values
     - The repository behaves as expected for both complete and partial updates
     - Tests properly verify field preservation behavior

## Next Steps

   - Refactor account type advanced tests:
     - advanced/account_types/banking/test_ewa_advanced.py
     - advanced/account_types/banking/test_payment_app_advanced.py
   - Refactor other repository tests:
     - test_base_repository.py
     - test_factory.py
     - test_feature_flag_repository.py
     - account_types/banking/test_checking.py
     - account_types/banking/test_credit.py
     - account_types/banking/test_savings.py

   - Update any documentation outside of test and implementation files
   - Ensure API documentation reflects new method names
   - Add comprehensive docstrings for the new methods
   - Add examples of using the new methods to system_patterns.md

## Implementation Lessons

1. **Schema-Model Field Alignment**
   - Keep model fields and schema fields aligned to prevent runtime errors
   - Validate that model fields can accept values from schema fields
   - Consider creating utility tools to verify schema-model compatibility
   - Move type-specific fields to the appropriate subclass schemas
   - Be careful about backward compatibility fields that could cause issues
   - Consider using field validation at the schema level for type-specific fields
   - Use proper inheritance patterns in both models and schemas
   - Ensure proper separation of concerns in the class hierarchy

2. **Polymorphic Repository Pattern**
   - Use specialized base repository for polymorphic entities (`PolymorphicBaseRepository`)
   - Disable base `create` and `update` methods with `NotImplementedError` to prevent incorrect usage
   - Implement type-specific creation and update methods (`create_typed_entity`, `update_typed_entity`)
   - Always use concrete subclasses that match the intended polymorphic type
   - Integrate with type registries for proper model class lookup
   - Implement automatic field validation and filtering based on model class
   - Ensure proper type handling and identity management
   - Prevent setting invalid fields that don't exist on specific model classes
   - Use consistent interface for all polymorphic repositories
   - Design for future expansion to support any number of polymorphic entity types
   - Preserve optional fields with existing values during partial updates
   - Skip setting optional fields to NULL if they already have a value

3. **Terminology Standardization**
   - Maintain consistent terminology across codebase (e.g., "liability" vs "bill")
   - Avoid parameter aliasing and dual naming conventions
   - Update tests and schemas to use the same terminology
   - Document naming conventions in repository method docstrings
   - Be explicit about relationships between different entity types
   - Consider adding alias methods only when absolutely necessary for compatibility

4. **Repository Fixture Usage Patterns**
   - Use repository_factory as a function, not as an object with methods
   - Understand the difference between class-based and function-based fixtures
   - Ensure consistent fixture usage patterns across similar repository types
   - Verify fixture implementation matches usage in tests
   - Document fixture usage patterns for team reference

5. **Repository Test Organization**
   - Separate CRUD tests from advanced repository tests
   - Place basic CRUD operations (create, get, update, delete) in crud/ directory
   - Place specialized operations in advanced/ directory
   - Maintain consistent test naming across similar repository types
   - Follow established patterns from working test files

6. **Feature Flag System Architecture**
   - Centralize feature flag enforcement at architectural boundaries instead of scattering checks
   - Use proxy/interceptor patterns to separate business logic from feature gating
   - Implement domain-specific exceptions for better error handling and clarity
   - Store both flag values AND requirements in the database for runtime configuration
   - Use caching with appropriate TTL for performance optimization
   - Implement account type extraction to support feature flags for specific account types
   - Follow bottom-up implementation approach starting at repository layer
   - Ensure consistent async/await patterns throughout the system
   - Use cache-aware testing strategies to handle TTL caching effects
   - Provide zero-TTL options for testing environments to avoid race conditions
   - Add helper utilities for clear cache invalidation when needed
   - Implement proper inspection of async methods to avoid mismatches

7. **Testing Transaction Boundaries**
   - Use `session.begin_nested()` for proper savepoint management
   - Test both successful and failing scenarios
   - Ensure proper rollback with transaction isolation
   - Verify no entities are created on failure
   - Test validation before and during transactions
   - Include specific validation for non-existent entities
   - Test for correct relationships between entities
   - Implement proper error handling with explicit error types
