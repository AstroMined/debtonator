## Implementation Lessons

1. **Polymorphic Schema Pattern with Pydantic V2**
   - Use Literal fields to enforce discriminator values in derived schemas:

   ```python
   # Base schema allows any valid account_type
   class AccountBase(BaseSchemaValidator):
       account_type: str = Field(..., description="Type of account")
   
   # Derived schema enforces a specific account_type
   class CheckingAccountBase(AccountBase):
       account_type: Literal["checking"] = "checking"
   ```

   - Use Annotated with Union and Field(discriminator=) for polymorphic API schemas:

   ```python
   from typing import Annotated, Union
   from pydantic import Field

   AccountCreateUnion = Annotated[
       Union[
           CheckingAccountCreate,
           SavingsAccountCreate,
           CreditAccountCreate,
       ],
       Field(discriminator="account_type")
   ]
   ```

   - With discriminated unions, client only needs to set account_type and other fields
   - API will automatically deserialize to the correct schema class
   - Always document discriminator field usage in schema docstrings

2. **Feature Flag Layer Integration**
   - Feature flags should be evaluated at the service layer, not directly in repositories
   - Integration tests for feature flags should test full flow from config to database
   - Flag values should be synchronized between registry (memory) and repository (database)
   - Design feature flags to handle context-specific evaluation
   - Use composition to build complex flag evaluation logic
   - Test both enabled and disabled states for proper flag behavior
   
   ```python
   # Feature flag service integration in service layer
   def get_available_account_types(self, user_id: int) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
       # Check if banking account types are enabled
       if not self.feature_flag_service.is_enabled("BANKING_ACCOUNT_TYPES_ENABLED"):
           # Return only basic account types if feature is disabled
           return self.registry.get_types_by_category("Basic")
       
       # Return all account types when feature is enabled
       return self.registry.get_all_types()
   ```

3. **Real Objects Testing Philosophy**
   - Never use mocks in tests - unittest.mock and MagicMock are strictly prohibited:

   ```python
   # Incorrect - using mocks:
   mock_repo = MagicMock()
   mock_repo.get.return_value = None
   service = AccountService(mock_repo)
   
   # Correct - using real objects:
   repo = AccountRepository(db_session)
   service = AccountService(repo)
   ```

   - Always use real repositories with the test database
   - Test database gets set up and torn down between each test
   - Test real cross-layer interactions instead of isolating components
   - Create real test data through schema factories and repository methods
   - Use real schema validation in every test
   - Integration-first approach gives higher confidence in production behavior

4. **Validator Method Calling Patterns**
   - When testing validator methods directly, don't pass the class as first argument:

   ```python
   # Incorrect:
   result = ModelClass.validator_method(ModelClass, value, info)
   
   # Correct:
   result = ModelClass.validator_method(value, info)
   ```

   - Pydantic v2 validator methods are already bound to the class
   - Using datetime_utils functions helps enforce ADR-011 compliance
   - Validation info objects should match Pydantic's ValidationInfo interface
   - Error assertion patterns should match Pydantic v2's error message format

5. **Type-Specific Validator Methods**
   - Implement cross-field validation using model validators:

   ```python
   @field_validator("overdraft_limit")
   @classmethod
   def validate_overdraft_limit(cls, value: Optional[Decimal], info: dict) -> Optional[Decimal]:
       has_protection = info.data.get("has_overdraft_protection", False)
       
       if has_protection and value is None:
           raise ValueError("Overdraft limit is required when overdraft protection is enabled")
           
       if not has_protection and value is not None:
           raise ValueError("Overdraft limit cannot be set when overdraft protection is disabled")
           
       return value
   ```

   - Validate complex business rules at the model level, not individual fields
   - Error messages should be clear and actionable
   - Use validation context (info.data) to access other field values
   - Always check for None values to handle partial updates
   - Consider the impact of concurrent validation on dependent fields
   - Each validator should focus on a single responsibility
