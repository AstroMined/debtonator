   - Ensure consistent fixture usage patterns across similar repository types
   - Verify fixture implementation matches usage in tests
   - Document fixture usage patterns for team reference

2. **Repository Test Organization**

   - Place specialized operations in advanced/ directory
   - Maintain consistent test naming across similar repository types
   - Follow established patterns from working test files

3. **Feature Flag System Architecture**
   - Centralize feature flag enforcement at architectural boundaries instead of scattering checks
   - Use proxy/interceptor patterns to separate business logic from feature gating
   - Implement domain-specific exceptions for better error handling and clarity
   - Store both flag values AND requirements in the database for runtime configuration
   - Use caching with appropriate TTL for performance optimization
   - Implement account type extraction to support feature flags for specific account types
