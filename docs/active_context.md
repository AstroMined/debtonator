## Next Steps

   - Implement changes outlined in ADR-017 to simplify the schema architecture
   - Follow the layer-by-layer implementation approach with testing at each step
   - Remove technical debt from the dual schema approach
   - Update all related tests and repositories

2. **Complete UTC Datetime Compliance**
   - Fix remaining naive datetime usage in repository tests identified by scanner
   - Add the naive datetime scanner to CI pipeline for continuous monitoring
   - Consider adding utility functions to production code for consistent datetime handling
   - Add automated tests to verify timezone consistency across service boundaries

3. **Service Layer Integration**
   - Refactor remaining services to use repositories
   - Create services for new repository models (PaymentSchedule, DepositSchedule, etc.)
   - Implement proper validation flow in services
   - Update API endpoints to use refactored services
   - Ensure transaction boundaries are respected

4. **Account Type Expansion Implementation (ADR-016)**
   - Implement field naming consistency (`type` → `account_type`) 
   - Fix parameter mapping inconsistencies in schema factories
   - Create consistent schema creation patterns in tests
   - Expand account type options with comprehensive validation
   - Enhance API documentation for account types

## Implementation Lessons

1. **Payment Source Schema Design**
   - Use a nested schema approach for child entities without requiring parent IDs
   - Parent-child relationships should be managed at the repository level
   - Avoid circular dependencies by properly modeling entity creation paths
   - Use explicit validation in test cases to catch schema validation issues
   - Document schema relationships to avoid confusion

2. **Repository Test Datetime Handling**
   - Store original timestamps before update operations for proper comparison
   - Use explicit variable storage rather than object attribute references
   - Avoid direct comparison of model attributes when dealing with timestamps
   - Be mindful of microsecond precision in datetime objects
   - Remember that SQLAlchemy may generate the same timestamp for very fast operations

3. **UTC Datetime Handling**
   - Always use timezone-aware datetime objects in tests with explicitly set UTC timezone
   - Use helper utilities like `utc_now()` and `utc_datetime()` instead of raw datetime constructors
   - Be careful with naive datetime comparisons in tests that can lead to validation errors
   - SQLite has limitations with timezone handling, so proper application-level enforcement is crucial
   - Standardize on using Python's `datetime.timezone.utc` for consistency
   - Use scanning tools periodically to identify naive datetime usage that might slip through

4. **Repository Test Pattern**
   - Four-step pattern is essential for proper testing:
     1. Arrange: Set up test dependencies
     2. Schema: Create and validate through Pydantic schemas
     3. Act: Convert validated data to dict and pass to repository
     4. Assert: Verify operation results
   - Create factory functions for all schema types
   - Never create raw dictionaries for repository methods
   - Always validate data through schemas before passing to repositories
   - Include test cases for validation errors
   - Use clear comments to mark each step in test methods for readability
