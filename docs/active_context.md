# Active Context: Debtonator

## Current Focus
Implementing Service Layer Refactoring (ADR-014)

### Recent Changes

1. **Created New Schema Factories for Additional Entities**
   - Added 6 new schema factories for previously unsupported entities:
     - balance_history.py: Created factory for balance tracking 
     - income.py: Implemented factories for income and recurring income
     - statement_history.py: Added support for credit statement histories
     - recurring_bills.py: Created factory for recurring bill patterns
     - deposit_schedules.py: Added factory for deposit scheduling
     - income_categories.py: Created simple category factory 
   - All factories follow the decorator pattern for validated schema creation
   - Maintained consistent naming and documentation standards
   - Included proper timezone-aware handling for datetime fields
   - Added appropriate field validations and default values

2. **Removed Schema Factories Backward Compatibility**
   - Eliminated façade pattern from schema_factories for cleaner imports
   - Updated all factory files to use the decorator pattern consistently
   - Enhanced base utilities with improved typing and constants
   - Fixed CreditLimitHistoryUpdate schema to include required effective_date 
   - Standardized factory return types and docstrings
   - Added comprehensive migration guide in README.md
   - Updated all factories to match current schema requirements
   - Maintained clear "_schema" suffix naming convention for clarity

3. **Implemented Repository Test Pattern Refactoring**
   - Created modular schema factories directory structure to prevent code bloat
   - Added domain-specific factory files organized by entity type
   - Updated ADR014 implementation checklist with detailed testing guidelines
   - Documented the Arrange-Schema-Act-Assert pattern for all repository tests
   - Created base utility functions for schema factory creation
   - Provided clear migration path for existing tests
   - Established BalanceReconciliationRepository as the reference implementation

4. **Fixed Balance Reconciliation Schema Validation** ✓
   - Added adjustment_amount as required field in BalanceReconciliationCreate schema
   - Ensured schema validation correctly enforces NOT NULL constraint from database model
   - Added field validator to verify adjustment_amount equals new_balance - previous_balance
   - Updated BalanceReconciliationUpdate to include new_balance and adjustment_amount fields
   - Documented special handling for repository testing patterns in schema

5. **Fixed Credit Limit History Repository Tests** ✓
   - Updated CreditLimitHistoryUpdate schema to require effective_date field
   - Fixed datetime comparison issue in date range test with timezone-aware handling
   - Aligned schema validation with database NOT NULL constraints
   - Properly handled timezone-aware vs. naive datetime comparison
   - Applied ADR-011 principles for UTC datetime standardization

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Schema Factory Tests**
   - Update all existing tests to use direct imports from domain modules
   - Ensure all test cases pass with new factory structure
   - Create robust testing examples using the new factory pattern
   - Add tests for schema validation edge cases

2. **Create Remaining Schema Factories**
   - Implement factories for remaining schema types:
     - categories.py
     - payment_patterns.py
     - payment_schedules.py
     - cashflow models

3. **Fix Remaining Test Issues**
   - Address updated_at timestamp issues in ORM updates
   - Fix date_trunc function missing in SQLite for monthly totals tests
   - Complete remaining transaction history repository tests
   - Fix SQLAlchemy ORM identity map issues
   - Enhance testing strategies for timezone handling
   - Resolve additional timezone comparison issues in repository tests

## Implementation Lessons

1. **Schema Factory Standardization**
   - Consistent parameter ordering improves readability (entity ID first, then key fields)
   - Good default values make tests more concise
   - UTC time handling must be consistent across all date-related factories
   - Factory docstrings should explain all parameters and default behaviors

2. **Technical Debt Avoidance**
   - Backward compatibility layers often become technical debt
   - Clean breaks with clear migration paths are preferable to maintaining compatibility layers
   - Document breaking changes thoroughly to ease transition
   - Prioritize long-term maintainability over short-term convenience

3. **Schema Factory Design Patterns**
   - Use decorators to standardize factory functions
   - Return validated schema instances to catch errors early
   - Provide sensible defaults for common test cases
   - Allow flexibility with kwargs pattern for edge cases
   - Use consistent naming conventions for better code readability

4. **Schema Validation and Database Constraints**
   - Align Pydantic schema requirements with database constraints
   - Required fields in the database should be required in all schemas
   - Field optionality should be consistent between create and update schemas
   - Maintain consistent validation rules across the application
