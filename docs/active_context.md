   - Added date range and filtering test patterns

3. **Implementation Checklist Progress** ✓
   - Marked additional repository tests as complete in ADR-014
   - Updated 3 more model-specific repository tests with Arrange-Schema-Act-Assert pattern
   - Identified remaining repository tests requiring refactoring
   - Prioritized next repository tests based on complexity
   - Focused on maintaining consistent test patterns
   - Ensured all test fixtures use schema validation flow

## Next Steps

1. **Service Layer Integration**
   - Refactor remaining services to use repositories
   - Create services for new repository models (PaymentSchedule, DepositSchedule, etc.)
   - Implement proper validation flow in services
   - Update API endpoints to use refactored services
   - Ensure transaction boundaries are respected

2. **Test Additional Repositories**
   - Continue refactoring remaining repository tests
   - Apply Arrange-Schema-Act-Assert pattern to all tests
   - Focus on high-traffic repositories first
   - Ensure consistent error handling patterns
   - Verify relationship loading behavior

3. **Documentation Updates**
   - Update API documentation for repository-based endpoints
   - Create service-to-repository integration examples
   - Document common repository usage patterns
   - Update OpenAPI documentation
   - Create examples of service-repository integration

## Implementation Lessons

1. **Repository Test Pattern**
   - Four-step pattern is essential for proper testing:
     1. Arrange: Set up test dependencies
     2. Schema: Create and validate through Pydantic schemas
     3. Act: Convert validated data to dict and pass to repository
     4. Assert: Verify operation results
   - Create factory functions for all schema types
   - Never create raw dictionaries for repository methods
   - Always validate data through schemas before passing to repositories
   - Include test cases for validation errors

2. **Schema Factory Design**
   - Provide reasonable defaults for all non-required fields
   - Use type hints for parameters and return values
   - Document parameters, defaults, and return types
   - Allow overriding any field with **kwargs
   - Return validated schema instances, not dictionaries
   - Implement factories for all primary and related schemas

3. **SQLAlchemy Query Optimization**
   - Use selectinload for one-to-many relationships
   - Use joinedload for many-to-one relationships
   - Build queries incrementally for better readability
   - Add appropriate ordering for predictable results
   - Use aliased classes for complex joins when needed
   - Optimize relationship loading to prevent N+1 query issues

4. **Repository Testing Considerations**
   - Create specific test cases for each method
   - Test both positive and negative scenarios
   - Validate relationship loading behavior
   - Ensure proper transaction handling
   - Test data retrieval and manipulation methods separately
   - Use schema factories to create valid test data
