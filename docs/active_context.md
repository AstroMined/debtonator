## Current Focus
Implementing Service Layer Refactoring (ADR-014)

### Recent Changes

1. **Completed Schema Factory Improvements** ✓
   - Fixed missing schema factories for comprehensive coverage:
     - liabilities.py: Added factories for `LiabilityInDB`, `LiabilityResponse`, `LiabilityDateRange`, `AutoPaySettings`, and `AutoPayUpdate`
     - bill_splits.py: Added factories for `BillSplitInDB`, `BillSplitResponse`, and analytics schemas
     - categories.py: Added factories for hierarchical categories (`CategoryWithChildren`, `CategoryWithParent`)
     - credit_limit_history.py: Added factories for history response types
     - recommendations.py: Created complete factory implementation
   - Implemented proper validation for complex schemas
   - Added robust default values for simpler testing
   - Enhanced support for nested schemas and relationships
   - Improved UTC timezone handling across all factories

2. **Completed All Missing Schema Factories** ✓
   - Implemented factories for all remaining schema types:
     - categories.py: Added factory for category creation and updates
     - payment_patterns.py: Created comprehensive factory functions for pattern analysis
     - payment_schedules.py: Implemented payment schedule schema factories
     - cashflow/: Created complete directory structure with factories for:
       - base.py: Basic cashflow models
       - metrics.py: Financial metrics models
       - account_analysis.py: Account analysis models
       - forecasting.py: Forecasting-related models
       - historical.py: Historical trend models
     - impact_analysis.py: Added factories for impact analysis models
     - income_trends.py: Created factories for income trend analysis
     - realtime_cashflow.py: Implemented real-time cashflow factories
   - All factories follow standard decorator pattern and naming conventions
   - Added proper nested factory support for complex models
   - Maintained consistent hierarchical structure for module organization
   - Provided rich default values for simpler test setup

3. **Created New Schema Factories for Additional Entities**
   - Added 6 new schema factories for previously unsupported entities:
     - balance_history.py: Created factory for balance tracking 
     - income.py: Implemented factories for income and recurring income
     - statement_history.py: Added support for credit statement histories
     - recurring_bills.py: Created factory for recurring bill patterns
     - deposit_schedules.py: Added factory for deposit scheduling
     - income_categories.py: Created simple category factory 
   - All factories follow the decorator pattern for validated schema creation
   - Maintained consistent naming and documentation standards
   - Included proper timezone-aware handling for datetime fields
   - Added appropriate field validations and default values

4. **Removed Schema Factories Backward Compatibility**
   - Eliminated façade pattern from schema_factories for cleaner imports
   - Updated all factory files to use the decorator pattern consistently
   - Enhanced base utilities with improved typing and constants
   - Fixed CreditLimitHistoryUpdate schema to include required effective_date 
   - Standardized factory return types and docstrings
   - Added comprehensive migration guide in README.md
   - Updated all factories to match current schema requirements
   - Maintained clear "_schema" suffix naming convention for clarity

5. **Implemented Repository Test Pattern Refactoring**
   - Created modular schema factories directory structure to prevent code bloat
   - Added domain-specific factory files organized by entity type
   - Updated ADR014 implementation checklist with detailed testing guidelines
   - Documented the Arrange-Schema-Act-Assert pattern for all repository tests
   - Created base utility functions for schema factory creation
   - Provided clear migration path for existing tests
   - Established BalanceReconciliationRepository as the reference implementation

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Schema Factory Tests**
   - Update all existing tests to use direct imports from domain modules
   - Ensure all test cases pass with new factory structure
   - Create robust testing examples using the new factory pattern
   - Add tests for schema validation edge cases
   - Create tests for all the newly implemented factory functions

2. **Improve Backward Compatibility Transition**
   - Remove deprecated compatibility files after all tests are updated
   - Document the migration process in the schema factory README
   - Create additional examples showing the new import patterns

3. **Fix Remaining Test Issues**
   - Address updated_at timestamp issues in ORM updates
   - Fix date_trunc function missing in SQLite for monthly totals tests
   - Complete remaining transaction history repository tests
   - Fix SQLAlchemy ORM identity map issues
   - Enhance testing strategies for timezone handling
   - Resolve additional timezone comparison issues in repository tests

## Implementation Lessons

1. **Schema Factory Standardization**
   - Consistent parameter ordering improves readability (entity ID first, then key fields)
   - Good default values make tests more concise
   - UTC time handling must be consistent across all date-related factories
   - Factory docstrings should explain all parameters and default behaviors
   - Parent-child relationships require careful handling with circular references
   - Nested schema factories need proper dependency management

2. **Technical Debt Avoidance**
   - Backward compatibility layers often become technical debt
   - Clean breaks with clear migration paths are preferable to maintaining compatibility layers
   - Document breaking changes thoroughly to ease transition
   - Prioritize long-term maintainability over short-term convenience

3. **Schema Factory Design Patterns**
   - Use decorators to standardize factory functions
   - Return validated schema instances to catch errors early
   - Provide sensible defaults for common test cases
   - Allow flexibility with kwargs pattern for edge cases
   - Use consistent naming conventions for better code readability
   - Handle nested schema creation with dependency injection

4. **Schema Validation and Database Constraints**
   - Align Pydantic schema requirements with database constraints
   - Required fields in the database should be required in all schemas
   - Field optionality should be consistent between create and update schemas
   - Maintain consistent validation rules across the application
   - Properly handle datetime fields with UTC timezone
