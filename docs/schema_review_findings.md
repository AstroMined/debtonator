# Schema Review Findings

This document contains detailed findings from reviewing each schema file in the `src/schemas` directory.

## Progress Update

- Review initiated: 2025-03-14
- Files reviewed: 21 of 21 (COMPLETE)
- Current focus: Establishing baseline compliance patterns

## __init__.py (BaseSchemaValidator)

### Compliance Summary
- ADR-011 Compliance: Fully Compliant
- ADR-012 Compliance: Fully Compliant
- DRY Principle: Good
- SRP Principle: Good

### Findings
1. The BaseSchemaValidator correctly implements the UTC timezone validation as specified in ADR-011
2. The class properly overrides model_validate to handle conversion of naive datetimes to UTC
3. The field_validator follows Pydantic V2 style with @classmethod decoration
4. Comprehensive docstrings with examples
5. Clear error messages that provide actionable information
6. Single responsibility: focuses only on datetime validation, not business logic
7. Properly configured json_encoders to handle datetime serialization

### Strengths
1. Centralizes datetime validation in one place, which all schemas inherit
2. Provides clear error messages that help developers understand what went wrong
3. Handles both validation and model_validate conversion, creating a robust system
4. Well-documented with examples

### Improvement Opportunities
None identified. The implementation is exemplary and should be considered a reference pattern.

## accounts.py

### Compliance Summary
- ADR-011 Compliance: Fully Compliant
- ADR-012 Compliance: Fully Compliant
- DRY Principle: Good
- SRP Principle: Good

### Findings
1. All schema classes properly inherit from BaseSchemaValidator
2. Uses Pydantic V2 style validators with @classmethod decoration
3. Clear separation between base, create, update, and response schemas
4. No business logic in validators - only structural validation
5. Proper use of Field constraints with descriptive messages
6. Datetime fields properly described as requiring UTC
7. Enum used for AccountType to restrict valid values
8. Docstrings present but could be enhanced with more details in some places

### Strengths
1. Logical schema hierarchy that prevents code duplication
2. Strong typing with meaningful constraints
3. Clear separation between validation and business logic
4. Comprehensive field validation including decimal places for monetary values

### Improvement Opportunities
1. Some validator logic is duplicated between AccountBase and AccountUpdate (the total_limit and available_credit validators)
2. Consider extracting common field definitions to reusable constants or functions
3. AccountUpdate validator implementations differ slightly from AccountBase - could be standardized

## payments.py

### Compliance Summary
- ADR-011 Compliance: Fully Compliant
- ADR-012 Compliance: Fully Compliant
- DRY Principle: Good
- SRP Principle: Good

### Findings
1. All schema classes properly inherit from BaseSchemaValidator
2. Uses Pydantic V2 style validators with @classmethod decoration
3. Clear separation between base, create, update, and response schemas
4. Proper validation of decimal precision for monetary values
5. Complex validation for payment sources that verifies sum equals total payment amount
6. Datetime fields properly validated through BaseSchemaValidator
7. Field descriptions include UTC for datetime fields

## liabilities.py

### Compliance Summary
- ADR-011 Compliance: Fully Compliant
- ADR-012 Compliance: Mostly Compliant
- DRY Principle: Needs Improvement
- SRP Principle: Good

### Findings
1. All schema classes properly inherit from BaseSchemaValidator
2. Uses Pydantic V2 style validators with @classmethod decoration
3. Proper validation of datetime fields, with additional business rule that due_date must not be in the past

6. Several duplicate Field definitions between base and update schemas

### Strengths
1. Good use of nested schemas for AutoPaySettings
2. Strong validation rules for datetime and decimal fields
3. Clear error messages in validators

### Improvement Opportunities
1. The validator for days_before_due relies on __fields__ which is not recommended in Pydantic V2
2. Forward declaration of AutoPaySettings is awkward with quoted type annotation
3. LiabilityUpdate and LiabilityBase have a lot of duplicate field definitions
4. validate_due_date_not_past may be considered business logic rather than pure validation

- **Partially Compliant**: 3 files (14%) - Down from 7 files (33%)
- **Non-Compliant**: 2 files (10%) - Down from 10 files (48%)

### ADR-012 (Validation Layer Standardization)
- **Fully Compliant**: 19 files (90%) ✅ - Up from 12 files (57%)
- **Mostly Compliant**: 1 file (5%) - Down from 2 files (10%)
- **Partially Compliant**: 1 file (5%) - Same as before
- **Non-Compliant**: 0 files (0%) - Down from 5 files (24%)

### DRY Principle
- **Good**: 20 files (95%) ✅ - Up from 13 files (62%)
- **Needs Improvement**: 1 file (5%) - Down from 2 files (10%)
- **Poor**: 0 files (0%) - Down from 6 files (29%)

### SRP Principle
- **Good**: 21 files (100%) ✅ - Up from 20 files (95%)
- **Needs Improvement**: 0 files (0%) - Down from 1 file (5%)

### Major Improvements Made

1. **Base Class Inheritance**: All schema classes in 16 files now properly inherit from BaseSchemaValidator
2. **Datetime Standardization**: Removed custom datetime validation in 16 files, now using BaseSchemaValidator for UTC validation
3. **Timezone Consistency**: Replaced ZoneInfo with timezone.utc in 16 files for consistent timezone handling
4. **Documentation**: Added comprehensive docstrings and field descriptions to 16 files
5. **Validation Improvements**: 
   - Added proper decimal_places validation for monetary fields
   - Added field constraints (max_length, ge, gt, le) for appropriate fields
   - Improved docstrings for validator methods with proper Args/Returns/Raises sections
   - Enhanced field descriptions with clear purpose statements
   - Fixed union type syntax to modern Type | None pattern
6. **Migration to Pydantic V2**: Replaced Config class with ConfigDict in all updated files

### Remaining Issues to Address

1. **Files Needing Refactoring**: There are still approximately 2 files that need to be updated to meet all standards
2. **Key Issues in Remaining Files**:
   - Custom datetime validation that should be handled by BaseSchemaValidator
   - Inconsistent docstring standards
   - Missing field descriptions and constraints
   - Circular import handling that could be improved

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Refactoring of Remaining Files:**
   - Address the last 2 files with ADR-011 compliance issues
   - Ensure all files meet the documentation standards established
   - Complete any remaining Pydantic V2 migrations

2. **Schema Testing Enhancement:**
   - Add more comprehensive tests for schema validation
   - Ensure all edge cases are properly tested
   - Validate datetime handling across all schemas
   - Test field constraints for proper validation

3. **Validation Document Updates:**
   - Update technical documentation with standardized validation patterns
   - Create developer guide for schema pattern usage
   - Document common validation patterns for datetime, decimal, and string fields

4. **Final Compliance Check:**
   - Create automated tool to verify compliance with ADRs
   - Update all docstrings to standard format
   - Ensure consistent field descriptions across all schemas
   - Verify decimal precision for all monetary fields
