"""
Schema factory functions for tests.

This module provides factory functions that generate valid Pydantic schema instances
for use in tests. Using these factories ensures that all repository tests follow
the proper validation flow by passing data through Pydantic schemas first.

This is a fa√ßade that re-exports factory functions from domain-specific modules
to maintain backward compatibility while allowing a more organized structure.
