# Feature Flags Integration Tests

This directory contains end-to-end integration tests for the Feature Flag System implemented in ADR-024. These tests verify that the entire feature flag stack works correctly, from the database to the API layer.

## Testing Approach

Feature Flag integration tests follow these principles:

1. **Cross-Layer Testing**: Tests verify that all layers properly enforce feature flags
2. **Real Components**: Tests use real services, repositories, and API endpoints
3. **Database Testing**: Tests interact with a real test database
4. **Full Requirements Flow**: Tests verify that requirement changes properly propagate through all layers
5. **Performance Testing**: Tests verify that the caching mechanism works properly

## Test Focus Areas

The end-to-end integration tests focus on these key aspects:

1. **Requirements Propagation**: Changes to requirements properly apply at all layers
2. **Layer Enforcement**: Each layer (repository, service, API) correctly enforces its requirements
3. **Cache Invalidation**: Cache is properly invalidated when requirements change
4. **Performance Overhead**: Feature flag enforcement has acceptable performance overhead
5. **Error Messages**: Appropriate error messages are generated at each layer

## Example Test Flow

A typical end-to-end test will:

1. **Configure**: Set up initial feature flags and requirements in the database
2. **Verify API Layer**: Test API endpoints with the feature flag enabled/disabled
3. **Verify Service Layer**: Test service methods with the feature flag enabled/disabled
4. **Verify Repository Layer**: Test repository methods with the feature flag enabled/disabled
5. **Modify Requirements**: Change requirements and verify changes propagate correctly
6. **Test Cache**: Verify caching behavior and invalidation works properly
